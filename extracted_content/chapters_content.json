This is the question this story delicately poses.\nLencho is a farmer who writes a letter to God when his crops\nare ruined, asking for a hundred pesos. Does Lencho’s letter reach\nGod? Does God send him the money? Think what your answers to\nthese questions would be, and guess how the story continues, before\nyou begin to read it.\nActivity\n1.\nOne of the cheapest ways to send money to someone is through\nthe post office. Have you ever sent or received money in this\nway?  Here’s what you have to do.  (As you read the instructions,\ndiscuss with your teacher in class the meanings of these words:\ncounter, counter clerk, appropriate, acknowledgement, counterfoil,\nrecord.

From this height one\ncould see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted\nwith the flowers that always promised a good\nharvest. The only thing the earth needed was a\ndownpour or at least a shower. Throughout the\nmorning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately\n— had done nothing else but see the sky towards\nthe north-east.\n“Now we’re really going to get some water, woman.”\nThe woman who was preparing supper, replied,\n“Yes, God willing”. The older boys were working in\nthe field, while the smaller ones were playing near\nthe house until the woman called to them all, “Come\nfor dinner”. It was during the meal that, just as\ncrest\ntop of a hill\n• Think about who you will send the money to, and how much.\nYou might want to send money for a magazine subscription,\nor to a relative or a friend.\n• Or you may fill out the form with yourself as sender and your\npartner as receiver.

In the north-east huge mountains of clouds\ncould be seen approaching. The air was fresh and\nsweet. The man went out for no other reason than\nto have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body,\nand when he returned he exclaimed, ‘‘These aren’t\nraindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.\nThe big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones\nare fives.’’\nWith a satisfied expression he regarded the field\nof ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of\nrain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow\nand along with the rain very large hailstones began\nto fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.\nThe boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out\nto collect the frozen pearls.\n‘‘It’s really getting bad now,’’ exclaimed the man.\n“I hope it passes quickly.” It did not pass quickly.\nFor an hour the hail rained on the house, the\ngarden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole\nvalley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.\nNot a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was\ntotally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the\nplants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness. When\nthe storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the\nfield and said to his sons, “A plague of locusts would\ndraped\ncovered (with cloth)\nlocusts\ninsects which fly in\nbig swarms (groups)\nand destroy crops\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Letter to God\n5\nhave left more than this. The hail has left nothing.\nThis year we will have no corn.’’\nThat night was a sorrowful one.\n“All our work, for nothing.”\n‘‘There’s no one who can help us.”\n“We’ll all go hungry this year.”\nOral Comprehension Check\n1.\nWhat did Lencho hope for?\n2.\nWhy did Lencho say the raindrops were like ‘new coins’?\n3.\nHow did the rain change? What happened to Lencho’s fields?\n4.\nWhat were Lencho’s feelings when the hail stopped?\nBut in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary\nhouse in the middle of the valley, there was a single\nhope: help from God.\n“Don’t be so upset, even though this seems like\na total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.”\n“That’s what they say: no one dies of hunger.”\nAll through the night, Lencho thought only of\nhis one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he\nhad been instructed, see everything, even what is\ndeep in one’s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a\nman, working like an animal in the fields, but still\nhe knew how to write. The following Sunday, at\ndaybreak, he began to write a letter which he\nhimself would carry to town and place in the mail.\nIt was nothing less than a letter to God.\n“God,” he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family\nand I will go hungry this year. I need a hundred\npesos in order to sow my field again and to live\nuntil the crop comes, because the hailstorm....”\nHe wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter\ninside and, still troubled, went to town. At the post\noffice, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped\nit into the mailbox.\nOne of the employees, who was a postman and\nalso helped at the post office, went to his boss\nlaughing heartily and showed him the letter to God.\nNever in his career as a postman had he known\nthat address. The postmaster — a fat, amiable\npeso\ncurrency of several\nLatin American\ncountries\nconscience\nan inner sense of\nright and wrong\namiable\nfriendly and\npleasant\nReprint 2025-26\n\n6\nFirst Flight\nfellow — also broke out laughing, but almost\nimmediately he turned serious and, tapping the\nletter on his desk, commented, “What faith! I wish I\nhad the faith of the man who wrote this letter.\nStarting up a correspondence with God!”\nSo, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God,\nthe postmaster came up with an idea: answer the\nletter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to\nanswer it he needed something more than goodwill,\nink and paper. But he stuck to his resolution: he\nasked for money from his employees, he himself gave\npart of his salary, and several friends of his were\nobliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’.\nIt was impossible for him to gather together the\nhundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer\nonly a little more than half. He put the money in an\nenvelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter\ncontaining only a single word as a signature: God.\nOral Comprehension Check\n1.\nWho or what did Lencho have faith in? What did he do?\n2.\nWho read the letter?\n3.\nWhat did the postmaster do then?\nThe following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier\nthan usual to ask if there was a letter for him.\nIt was the postman himself who handed the letter\nto him while the postmaster, experiencing the\ncontentment of a man who has  performed a good\ndeed, looked on from his office.\nLencho showed not the slightest surprise on\nseeing the money; such was his confidence — but\nhe became angry when he counted the money. God\ncould not have made a mistake, nor could he have\ndenied Lencho what he had requested.\nImmediately, Lencho went up to the window to\nask for paper and ink. On the public writing-table,\nhe started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow,\ncaused by the effort he had to make to express his\nideas. When he finished, he went to the window to\nbuy a stamp which he licked and then affixed to\ncontentment\nsatisfaction\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Letter to God\n7\n1.\nWho does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell\nyou this?\n2.\nWhy does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the\nletter ‘God’?\n3.\nDid Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why/Why not?\n4.\nWho does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony\nin the situation? (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected\naspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or amusing because it is the\nopposite of what is expected.)\nthe envelope with a blow of his fist. The moment\nthe letter fell into the mailbox the postmaster went\nto open it. It said: “God: Of the money that I asked\nfor, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the\nrest, since I need it very much. But don’t send it to\nme through the mail because the post office\nemployees are a bunch of crooks. Lencho.”\nOral Comprehension Check\n1.\nWas Lencho surprised to find a letter for him with money in it?\n2.\nWhat made him angry?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n8\nFirst Flight\n5.\nAre there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you\nsay he is? You may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.\ngreedy\nnaive\nstupid\nungrateful\nselfish\ncomical\nunquestioning\n6.\nThere are two kinds of conflict in the story: between humans and nature,\nand between humans themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?\nI. Look at the following sentence from the story.\nSuddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large\nhailstones began to fall.\n‘Hailstones’ are small balls of ice that fall like rain. A storm in which\nhailstones fall is a ‘hailstorm’. You know that a storm is bad weather with\nstrong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.\nThere are different names in different parts of the world for storms,\ndepending on their nature. Can you match the names in the box with\ntheir descriptions below, and fill in the blanks? You may use a dictionary\nto help you.\ngale,\nwhirlwind,\ncyclone,\nhurricane,\ntornado,\ntyphoon\n1.\nA violent tropical storm in which strong winds move in a circle:\n__ __ c __ __ __ __\n2.\nAn extremely strong wind : __ a __ __\n3.\nA violent tropical storm with very strong winds : __ __ p __ __ __ __\n4.\nA violent storm whose centre is a cloud in the shape of a funnel:\n__ __ __ n __ __ __\n5.\nA violent storm with very strong winds, especially in the western Atlantic\nOcean: __ __ r __ __ __ __ __ __\n6.\nA very strong wind that moves very fast in a spinning movement and\ncauses a lot of damage: __ __ __ __ l __ __ __ __\nII. Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story:\n(a) I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly.\n(b) There was a single hope: help from God.\nIn the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to\nhappen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something\nto happen.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Letter to God\n9\nIII. Relative Clauses\nLook at these sentences\n(a) All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately — looked at\nthe sky.\n(b) The woman, who was preparing supper, replied, “Yes, God willing.’’\nThe italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho\nand the woman. We call them relative clauses. Notice that they begin with\na relative pronoun who. Other common relative pronouns are whom, whose,\nand which.\nThe relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining, because\nwe already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a\nparticular person, and there is a particular woman he speaks to. We don’t\nneed the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a\nlarger set.\nA non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a\ncomma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the\nrelative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop.\nJoin the sentences given below using who, whom, whose, which, as\nsuggested.\n1.\nI often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. (which)\n2.\nMy mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very\nwell. (who)\nB\n– a feeling that something good will\nprobably happen\n– thinking that this would happen\n(It may or may not have happened.)\n– stopped believing that this good\nthing would happen\n– wanting something to happen\n(and thinking it quite possible)\n– showing concern that what you\nsay should not offend or disturb\nthe other person: a way of being\npolite\n– wishing for something to happen,\nalthough this is very unlikely\nA\n1.\nWill you get the subjects you want\nto study in college?\nI hope so.\n2.\nI hope you don’t mind my saying\nthis, but I don’t like the way you\nare arguing.\n3.\nThis discovery will give new hope\nto HIV/AIDS sufferers.\n4.\nWe were hoping against hope that\nthe judges would not notice our\nmistakes.\n5.\nI called early in the hope of\nspeaking to her before she went\nto school.\n6.\nJust when everybody had given up\nhope, the fishermen came back,\nseven days after the cyclone.\nMatch the sentences in Column A with the meanings of ‘hope’ in Column B.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n10\nFirst Flight\n3.\nThese sportspersons are going to meet the President. Their performance\nhas been excellent. (whose)\n4.\nLencho prayed to God. His eyes see into our minds. (whose)\n5.\nThis man cheated me. I trusted him. (whom)\nSometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For\nexample, look at the first sentence of the story:\n(a) The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a\nlow hill.\nWe can rewrite this sentence as:\n(b) The house — which was the only one in the entire valley — sat on\nthe crest of a low hill.\nIn (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present.\nIV. Using Negatives for Emphasis\nWe know that sentences with words such as no, not or nothing show the\nabsence of something, or contradict something. For example:\n(a) This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)\n(b) The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)\n(c) These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.\n(Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from\nthe sky are)\nBut sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \nParagraph (1) \n(ii) \nWhich of the following statements best describes the comparison \nmade in the sentence ? \n1 \n \n‘‘Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices.’’  \n(A) \nGold and saffron have similar physical properties. \n(B) \nGold and saffron have equal monetary value. \n(C) \nSaffron is considered the most valuable spice, similar to how \ngold is valued among metals.  \n(D) \nGold and saffron are both rare commodities in the global \nmarket.

The\ninauguration would be the largest gathering ever of\ninternational leaders on South African soil.\nThe ceremonies took place in the lovely\nsandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union\nBuildings in Pretoria.

What does he mean by this? What is the “glorious …\nhuman achievement” he speaks of at the end?\n4.\nWhat does Mandela thank the international leaders for?\n5.\nWhat ideals does he set out for the future of South Africa?\nA few moments later we all lifted our eyes in\nawe as a spectacular array of South African jets,\nhelicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect\nformation over the Union Buildings. It was not only\na display of pinpoint precision and military force,\nbut a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to\ndemocracy, to a new government that had been\nfreely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the\nhighest generals of the South African defence force\nand police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and\nmedals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged\ntheir loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that\nnot so many years before they would not have\nsaluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala\njets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue\nand gold of the new South African flag.\nThe day was symbolised for me by the playing of\nour two national anthems, and the vision of whites\nsinging ‘Nkosi Sikelel –iAfrika’ and blacks singing\n‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although\nthat day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem\nthey once despised, they would soon know the\nwords by heart.\nOn the day of the inauguration, I was\noverwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first\ndecade of the twentieth century, a few years after\nthe bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,\nthe white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched\nup their differences and erected a system of racial\ndomination against the dark-skinned peoples of their\nown land. The structure they created formed the\nbasis of one of the harshest, most inhumane,\nsocieties the world has ever known. Now, in the\nlast decade of the twentieth century, and my own\neighth decade as a man, that system had been\nnot unmindful of\nconscious of; aware of\nchevron\na pattern in the\nshape of a V\ndespised\nhad a very low\nopinion of\nspectacular array\nan impressive\ndisplay (colourful\nand attractive)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n20\nFirst Flight\nwrought (old\nfashioned, formal\nword)\ndone, achieved\nprofound\ndeep and strong\n* These are some prominent names in the struggle against apartheid.\n(For the use of the definite article with proper nouns, see exercise II on page 25)\nYusuf Dadoo\nBram Fischer\nChief Luthuli\nOliver Tambo\nWalter Sisulu\nRobert Sobukwe\noverturned forever and replaced by one that\nrecognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples,\nregardless of the colour of their skin.\nThat day had come about through the\nunimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,\npeople whose suffering and courage can never be\ncounted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so\nmany other days, that I was simply the sum of all\nthose African patriots who had gone before me. That\nlong and noble line ended and now began again\nwith me. I was pained that I was not able to thank\nthem and that they were not able to see what their\nsacrifices had wrought.\nThe policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting\nwound in my country and my people. All of us will\nspend many years, if not generations, recovering\nfrom that profound hurt. But the decades of\noppression and brutality had another, unintended,\neffect, and that was that it produced the Oliver\nTambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the\nYusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert\nSobukwes of our time* — men of such extraordinary\nReprint 2025-26\n\n21\nNelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\ncourage, wisdom and generosity that their like may\nnever be known again. Perhaps it requires such\ndepths of oppression to create such heights of\ncharacter. My country is rich in the minerals and\ngems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always\nknown that its greatest wealth is its people, finer\nand truer than the purest diamonds.\nIt is from these comrades in the struggle that I\nlearned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I\nhave seen men and women risk and give their lives\nfor an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks\nand torture without breaking, showing a strength\nand resilience that defies the imagination. I learned\nthat courage was not the absence of fear, but the\ntriumph over it. The brave man is not he who does\nnot feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.\nNo one is born hating another person because of\nthe colour of his skin, or his background, or his\nreligion. People must learn to hate, and if they can\nlearn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love\ncomes more naturally to the human heart than its\nopposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when\nmy comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would\nsee a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards,\nperhaps just for a second, but it was enough to\nreassure me and keep me going.

But\nin a country like South Africa, it was almost\nimpossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil\nboth of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of\ncolour who attempted to live as a human being was\npunished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who\ntried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably\nripped from his family and his home and was forced\nto live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy\nand rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to\nplace my people above my family, but in attempting\nto serve my people, I found that I was prevented\nfrom fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a\nfather and a husband.\nI was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born\nfree — free in every way that I could know. Free to\nrun in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim\nin the clear stream that ran through my village, free\nto roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad\nbacks of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my\nfather and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was\nnot troubled by the laws of man or God.\nIt was only when I began to learn that my boyhood\nfreedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a\nyoung man that my freedom had already been taken\nfrom me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a\nstudent, I wanted freedom only for myself, the\ntransitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,\nread what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as\na young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the\nbasic and honourable freedoms of achieving my\npotential, of earning my keep, of marrying and\nhaving a family — the freedom not to be obstructed\nin a lawful life.\nBut then I slowly saw that not only was I not\nfree, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I\nsaw that it was not just my freedom that was\ncurtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked\nlike I did.

How does he conquer his fear?\nII. A pilot is lost in storm clouds. Does he arrive safe? Who helps\nhim?\nI\nHis First Flight\nTHE young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two\nbrothers and his sister had already flown away the\nday before. He had been afraid to fly with them.\nSomehow when he had taken a little run forward to\nthe brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his\nwings he became afraid. The great expanse of sea\nstretched down beneath, and it was such a long\nway down — miles down. He felt certain that his\nwings would never support him; so he bent his head\nand ran away back to the little hole under the ledge\nwhere he slept at night. Even when each of his\nbrothers and his little sister, whose wings were far\nshorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their\nwings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage\nto take that plunge which appeared to him so\ndesperate. His father and mother had come around\nledge\na narrow horizontal\nshelf projecting from\na wall or (here) a cliff\nReprint 2025-26\n\ncalling to him shrilly, upbraiding him, threatening\nto let him starve on his ledge unless he flew away.\nBut for the life of him he could not move.\nThat was twenty-four hours ago. Since then\nnobody had come near him. The day before, all day\nlong, he had watched his parents flying about with\nhis brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art\nof flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and\nhow to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older\nbrother catch his first herring and devour it,\nstanding on a rock, while his parents circled around\nraising a proud cackle. And all the morning the\nwhole family had walked about on the big plateau\nmidway down the opposite cliff taunting him with\nhis cowardice.\nThe sun was now ascending the sky, blazing on\nhis ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat\nbecause he had not eaten since the previous nightfall.\nHe stepped slowly out to the brink of the ledge,\nand standing on one leg with the other leg hidden\nunder his wing, he closed one eye, then the other,\nherring\na soft-finned sea fish\n(to) skim\nto move lightly just\nabove a surface\n(here, the sea)\nupbraiding\nscolding\n33\nTwo Stories about Flying\nReprint 2025-26\n\n34\nFirst Flight\nand pretended to be falling asleep. Still they took\nno notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his\nsister lying on the plateau dozing with their heads\nsunk into their necks. His father was preening the\nfeathers on his white back. Only his mother was\nlooking at him. She was standing on a little high\nhump on the plateau, her white breast thrust\nforward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish\nthat lay at her feet and then scrapped each side of\nher beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened\nhim. How he loved to tear food that way, scrapping\nhis beak now and again to whet it.\n“Ga, ga, ga,” he cried begging her to bring him\nsome food. “Gaw-col-ah,” she screamed back\nderisively. But he kept calling plaintively, and\nafter a minute or so he uttered a joyful scream.\nHis mother had picked up a piece of the fish and\nwas flying across to him with it.

But when\nshe was just opposite to him, she halted, her\nwings motionless, the piece of fish in her beak\nalmost within reach of his beak. He waited a\nmoment in surprise, wondering why she did not\ncome nearer, and then, maddened by hunger, he\ndived at the fish. With a loud scream he fell\noutwards and downwards into space. Then a\nmonstrous terror seized him and his heart stood\nstill. He could hear nothing. But it only lasted a\nminute. The next moment he felt his wings spread\noutwards. The wind rushed against his breast\nfeathers, then under his stomach, and against his\nwings. He could feel the tips of his wings cutting\nthrough the air. He was not falling headlong now.\nHe was soaring gradually downwards and outwards.\nHe was no longer afraid. He just felt a bit dizzy.\nThen he flapped his wings once and he soared\nupwards. “Ga, ga, ga, Ga, ga, ga, Gaw-col-ah,” his\nmother swooped past him, her wings making a\nloud noise. He answered her with another scream.\nThen his father flew over him screaming. He saw\nhis two brothers and his sister flying around him\ncurveting and banking and soaring and diving.\nThen he completely forgot that he had not always\nbeen able to fly, and commended himself to dive\nand soar and curve, shrieking shrilly.\nHe was near the sea now, flying straight over\nit, facing straight out over the ocean.

I was happy to be\nalone high up above the sleeping countryside. I was\nflying my old Dakota aeroplane over France back to\nEngland. I was dreaming of my holiday and looking\nforward to being with my family. I looked at my\nwatch: one thirty in the morning.\n‘I should call Paris Control soon,’ I thought. As I\nlooked down past the nose of the aeroplane, I saw\nthe lights of a big city in front of me. I switched on\nthe radio and said, “Paris Control, Dakota DS 088\nhere. Can you hear me? I’m on my way to England.\nOver.”\nThe voice from the radio answered me immediately:\n“DS 088, I can hear you. You ought to turn twelve\ndegrees west now, DS 088. Over.”\nI checked the map and the compass, switched\nover to my second and last fuel tank, and turned\nthe Dakota twelve degrees west towards England.\n‘I’ll be in time for breakfast,’ I thought. A good\nbig English breakfast! Everything was going well —\nit was an easy flight.\nParis was about 150 kilometres behind me when\nI saw the clouds. Storm clouds. They were huge.\nThey looked like black mountains standing in front\nof me across the sky. I knew I could not fly up and\nover them, and I did not have enough fuel to fly\naround them to the north or south.\n“I ought to go back to Paris,” I thought, but I\nwanted to get home. I wanted that breakfast.\n‘I’ll take the risk,’ I thought, and flew that old\nDakota straight into the storm.\nInside the clouds, everything was suddenly black.\nIt was impossible to see anything outside the\naeroplane. The old aeroplane jumped and twisted\nin the air. I looked at the compass. I couldn’t believe\nReprint 2025-26\n\n38\nFirst Flight\nmy eyes: the compass was turning round and round\nand round. It was dead. It would not work! The\nother instruments were suddenly dead, too. I tried\nthe radio.\n“Paris Control? Paris Control? Can you hear me?”\nThere was no answer. The radio was dead too. I\nhad no radio, no compass, and I could not see where\nI was. I was lost in the storm. Then, in the black\nclouds quite near me, I saw another aeroplane. It\nhad no lights on its wings, but I could see it flying\nnext to me through the storm. I could see the pilot’s\nface — turned towards me. I was very glad to see\nanother person. He lifted one hand and waved.\n“Follow me,” he was saying. “Follow me.”\n‘He knows that I am lost,’ I thought. ‘He’s trying\nto help me.’\nHe turned his aeroplane slowly to the north, in\nfront of my Dakota, so that it would be easier for\nme to follow him. I was very happy to go behind the\nstrange aeroplane like an obedient child.\nAfter half an hour the strange black aeroplane\nwas still there in front of me in the clouds. Now\nReprint 2025-26\n\n39\nTwo Stories about Flying\nthere was only enough fuel in the old Dakota’s last\ntank to fly for five or ten minutes more. I was\nstarting to feel frightened again. But then he started\nto go down and I followed through the storm.\nSuddenly I came out of the clouds and saw two\nlong straight lines of lights in front of me. It was a\nrunway! An airport! I was safe! I turned to look for\nmy friend in the black aeroplane, but the sky was\nempty. There was nothing there. The black\naeroplane was gone. I could not see it anywhere.\nI landed and was not sorry to walk away from the\nold Dakota near the control tower. I went and asked\na woman in the control centre where I was and who\nthe other pilot was. I wanted to say ‘Thank you’.\nShe looked at me very strangely, and then\nlaughed.\n“Another aeroplane? Up there in this storm? No\nother aeroplanes were flying tonight. Yours was the\nonly one I could see on the radar.”\nSo who helped me to arrive there safely without\na compass or a radio, and without any more fuel in\nmy tanks? Who was the pilot on the strange black\naeroplane, flying in the storm, without lights?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n40\nFirst Flight\n1.\n“I’ll take the risk.” What is the risk? Why does the narrator take it?\n2.\nDescribe the narrator’s experience as he flew the aeroplane into the storm.\n3.\nWhy does the narrator say, “I landed and was not sorry to walk away from\nthe old Dakota…”?\n4.\nWhat made the woman in the control centre look at the narrator strangely?\n5.\nWho do you think helped the narrator to reach safely?  Discuss this among\nyourselves and give reasons for your answer.\nI. Study the sentences given below.\n(a) They looked like black mountains.\n(b) Inside the clouds, everything was suddenly black.\n(c) In the black clouds near me, I saw another aeroplane.\n(d) The strange black aeroplane was there.\nThe word ‘black’ in sentences (a) and (c) refers to the very darkest colour.\nBut in (b) and (d) (here) it means without light/with no light.\n‘Black’ has a variety of meanings in different contexts. For example:\n(a) ‘I prefer black tea’ means ‘I prefer tea without milk’.\n(b) ‘With increasing pollution the future of the world is black’ means\n‘With increasing pollution the future of the world is very depressing/\nwithout hope’.\nNow, try to guess the meanings of the word ‘black’ in the sentences\ngiven below. Check the meanings in the dictionary and find out whether\nyou have guessed right.\n1.\nGo and have a bath; your hands and face are absolutely black.\n2.\nThe taxi-driver gave Ratan a black look as he crossed the road when the\ntraffic light was green. \n3.\nThe bombardment of Hiroshima is one of the blackest crimes against\nhumanity. \n4.\nVery few people enjoy Harold Pinter’s black comedy. \n5.\nSometimes shopkeepers store essential goods to create false scarcity\nand then sell these in black. \n6.\nVillagers had beaten the criminal black and blue. \nReprint 2025-26\n\n41\nTwo Stories about Flying\nA\nB\n1.\nFly a flag\n– Move quickly/suddenly\n2.\nFly into rage\n– Be successful\n3.\nFly along\n– Display a flag on a long pole\n4.\nFly high\n– Escape from a place\n5.\nFly the coop\n– Become suddenly very angry\nII.

It could be about flying in an\nairplane, or flying a kite, or about watching a bird flying — in short, anything to do\nwith flight.

    "book_content": "BEFORE YOU READ\nAnneliese Marie ‘Anne’ Frank (12\nJune 1929 – February/March\n1945) was a German – born\nJewish girl who wrote while in\nhiding with her family and four\nfriends in Amsterdam during the\nGerman occupation of the\nNetherlands in World War II. Her\nfamily had moved to Amsterdam\nafter the Nazis gained power in\nGermany but were trapped when\nthe Nazi occupation extended into\nthe Netherlands. As persecutions\nagainst the Jewish population\nincreased, the family went into\nhiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank’s\noffice building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed\nand transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died\nof typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank.\nHer father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam\nafter the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced\nthat it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in\nEnglish under the name The Diary of a Young Girl.\nThe diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday\nand chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its\nfinal entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its\noriginal Dutch into many languages and became one of the world’s\nmost widely read books. There have also been several films,\ntelevision and theatrical productions, and even an opera, based on\nthe diary. Described as the work of a mature and insightful mind,\nthe diary provides an intimate examination of daily life under Nazi\noccupation. Anne Frank has become one of the most renowned and\ndiscussed of the Holocaust victims.\n“This is a photo as I would wish\nmyself to look all the time. Then\nI would, maybe, have a chance\nto come to Hollywood.”\n– Anne Frank, 10 October 1942\nReprint 2025-26\n\n2.\nHere are some entries from personal records.

Given below under ‘A’ are some terms we\nuse to describe a written record of personal experience. Can\nyou match them with their descriptions under ‘B’? (You may\nlook up the terms in a dictionary if you wish.)\nB\n– A book with a separate space or page for each\nday, in which you write down your thoughts\nand feelings or what has happened on that day\n– A full record of a journey, a period of time, or\nan event, written every day\n– A record of a person’s own life and experiences\n(usually, a famous person)\n– A written record of events with times and\ndates, usually official\nA\n(i) Journal\n(ii) Diary\n(iii) Log\n(iv) Memoir(s)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n50\nFirst Flight\nWRITING in a diary is a really strange experience for\nsomeone like me. Not only because I’ve never written\nanything before, but also because it seems to me\nthat later on neither I nor anyone else will be\ninterested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old\nschoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn’t matter. I feel like\nwriting, and I have an even greater need to get all\nkinds of things off my chest.\n‘Paper has more patience than people.’ I thought\nof this saying on one of those days when I was feeling\na little depressed and was sitting at home with my\nchin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering\nwhether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I\nwas, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience,\nand since I’m not planning to let anyone else read\nthis stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a\n‘diary’, unless I should ever find a real friend, it\nprobably won’t make a bit of difference.\nNow I’m back to the point that prompted me\nto keep a diary in the first place: I don’t have a\nfriend.\nLet me put it more clearly, since no one will\nbelieve that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely\nalone in the world. And I’m not. I have loving parents\nand a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about\nthirty people I can call friends. I have a family,\nloving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I\nseem to have everything, except my one true friend.\nAll I think about when I’m with friends is having a\ngood time. I can’t bring myself to talk about anything\nbut ordinary everyday things. We don’t seem to be\nable to get any closer, and that’s the problem. Maybe\nit’s my fault that we don’t confide in each other. In\nany case, that’s just how things are, and\nunfortunately they’re not liable to change. This is\nwhy I’ve started the diary.\nTo enhance the image of this long-awaited friend\nin my imagination, I don’t want to jot down the\nfacts in this diary the way most people would do,\nbut I want the diary to be my friend, and I’m going\nto call this friend ‘Kitty’.\nlistless\nwith no  energy or\ninterest\nconfide\nto tell personal\nthings privately to a\nperson that one\ntrusts\nReprint 2025-26\n\n51\nFrom the Diary of Anne Frank\nOral Comprehension Check\n1.\nWhat makes writing in a diary a strange experience for Anne Frank?\n2.\nWhy does Anne want to keep a diary?\n3.\nWhy did Anne think she could confide more in her diary than in people?\nSince no one would understand a word of my\nstories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I’d better\nprovide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike\ndoing so.\nMy father, the most adorable father I’ve ever seen,\ndidn’t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and\nshe was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born\nin Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12\nJune 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My\nfather emigrated to Holland in 1933. My mother,\nEdith Hollander Frank, went with him to Holland\nin September, while Margot and I were sent to\nAachen to stay with our grandmother. Margot went\nto Holland in December, and I followed in February,\nwhen I was plunked down on the table as a birthday\npresent for Margot.\nI started right away at the Montessori nursery\nschool. I stayed there until I was six, at which time\nI started in the first form. In the sixth form my\nteacher was Mrs Kuperus, the headmistress.

The\nreason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in\nwhich the teachers decide who’ll move up to the\nnext form and who’ll be kept back. Half the class is\nmaking bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the\ntwo boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have\nstaked their entire holiday savings on their bet.\nFrom morning to night, it’s “You’re going to pass”,\n“No, I’m not”, “Yes, you are”, “No, I’m not”. Even G.’s\npleading glances and my angry outbursts can’t calm\nthem down. If you ask me, there are so many\ndummies that about a quarter of the class should\nbe kept back, but teachers are the most\nunpredictable creatures on earth.\nI’m not so worried about my girlfriends and\nmyself. We’ll make it. The only subject I’m not sure\nabout is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until\nthen, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.\nI get along pretty well with all my teachers. There\nare nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr\nKeesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was\nannoyed with me for ages because I talked so much.\nAfter several warnings, he assigned me extra\nhomework. An essay on the subject, ‘A Chatterbox’.\nA chatterbox — what can you write about that? I’d\nworry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the\ntitle in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried\nto keep quiet.\nThat evening, after I’d finished the rest of my\nhomework, the note about the essay caught my eye.\nI began thinking about the subject while chewing\nthe tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on\nand leave big spaces between the words, but the\ntrick was to come up with convincing arguments to\nprove the necessity of talking. I thought and\nthought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the\nthree pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was\nsatisfied. I argued that talking is a student’s trait\nand that I would do my best to keep it under control,\nold fogey\nan old-fashioned\nperson\nramble on\ntalk or write\naimlessly for long\nconvincing\nargument\na statement made in\nsuch a manner that\npeople believe it\nquaking in its boots\nshaking with fear\nand nervousness\nReprint 2025-26\n\n53\nFrom the Diary of Anne Frank\nbut that I would never be able to cure myself of the\nhabit since my mother talked as much as I did if\nnot more, and that there’s not much you can do\nabout inherited traits.\nMr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments,\nbut when I proceeded to talk my way through the\nnext lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This\ntime it was supposed to be on ‘An Incorrigible\nChatterbox’. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had\nnothing to complain about for two whole lessons.\nHowever, during the third lesson he’d finally had\nenough. “Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in\nclass, write an essay entitled — ‘Quack, Quack,\nQuack, Said Mistress Chatterbox’.”\nincorrigible\nsomething that\ncannot be corrected\n(usually a bad\nquality)\ninherited traits\nqualities (physical or\nmental) that one gets\nfrom one’s parents\nThe class roared. I had to laugh too, though I’d\nnearly exhausted my ingenuity on the topic of\nchatterboxes. It was time to come up with\nsomething else, something original. My friend,\nSanne, who’s good at poetry, offered to help me write\nthe essay from beginning to end in verse and I\njumped for joy. Mr Keesing was trying to play a\njoke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I’d make\nsure the joke was on him.\nI finished my poem, and it was beautiful! It was\nabout a mother duck and a father swan with three\nbaby ducklings who were bitten to death by the\nfather because they quacked too much. Luckily, Mr\nKeesing took the joke the right way. He read the\ningenuity\noriginality and\ninventiveness\nReprint 2025-26\n\n54\nFirst Flight\npoem to the class, adding his own comments, and\nto several other classes as well.

Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders.

From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east.

Can you keep a diary for a\nweek recording the events that occur? You may share your diary with your\nclass, if you wish to. Use the following hints to write your diary.\n•\nThough your diary is very private, write as if you are writing for someone else.\n•\nPresent your thoughts in a convincing manner.\n•\nUse words that convey your feelings, and words that ‘paint pictures’ for the\nreader. Be brief.\n‘Diary language’ has some typical features such as subjectless sentences (Got\nup late in the morning), sentence fragments without subjects or verbs (…too\nbad, boring, not good), contracted forms (they’re, I’ve, can’t, didn’t, etc.),  and\neveryday expressions which people use  in speech. Remember not to use such\nlanguage in more formal kinds of writing.\nYour teacher will read out an extract from The Diary of Samuel Pepys (given on\nthe next page) about the great fire of London.

She called at \n in\nthe morning. Pepys went back to sleep because \n. Pepys rose again at\n in the morning. By then about \n houses had been burned\ndown. The fire had spread to \n by London Bridge. Pepys then walked\nto the \n along with Sir J. Robinson’s \n.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWHAT WE HAVE DONE\n1.\nDiary writing is one of the best ways to practise writing. Students do not have to\nthink up or imagine what to write about; they only have to find words to write\nabout what has happened.  Initiate your students into the habit of keeping a diary.\n2.\nAnne Frank’s diary became a public document after World War II. Discuss with your\nstudents diaries which became historical documents, such as Samuel Pepys’s diary.\nYou may draw students’ attention to different types of diaries, e.g. private diary,\ngeneral diary. Army officers, businessmen, doctors, executives, lawyers, motorists,\npolice officers keep a general diary  to record events that happen during the day\nand events that are scheduled for the day, such as appointments, meetings, things\nto be done, etc.\n3.\nPassage for listening exercise:\nThe Great Fire of London [1666]\nSeptember 2nd (Lord’s Day). Jane called us up about three in the morning,\nto tell us of a great fire they saw in the city. So I rose and slipped on my\nnightgown, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the backside\nof Marke-Lane at the farthest; but being unused to such fire as followed,\nI thought it far enough off, and so went to bed again and to sleep.\nAbout seven rose again to dress myself, and then looked out of the\nwindow, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. By and by\nJane comes and tells me that she hears that above 300 houses have\nbeen burned down tonight by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning\ndown all Fish Street, by London Bridge.\nSo I made myself ready presently, and walked to the Tower, and there got\nup upon one of the high places, Sir J. Robinson’s little son going up with\nme; and there I did see the houses at that end of the bridge all on fire,\nand an infinite great fire on this and the other side of the bridge.\n[From The Diary of Samuel Pepys ]\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nAfter they have completed the lesson, including the writing exercise, students can be\nasked to make a diary jotting for the previous day. Perhaps you could also write a diary\nentry describing what happened in school/class on the previous day, to share with the\nclass — try and make it amusing and interesting!

These bakers are, even today,\nknown as pader in Goa.\nDuring our childhood in Goa, the baker used to\nbe our friend, companion and guide. He used to\ncome at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in\nthe morning on his selling round, and then again,\nwhen he returned after emptying his huge basket.\nThe jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from\nsleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was\nit so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The\nloaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine,\nthe maid-servant of the house! What we longed for\nwere those bread-bangles which we chose carefully.\nSometimes it was sweet bread of special make.\nThe baker made his musical entry on the scene\nwith the ‘jhang, jhang’ sound of his specially made\nbamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on\nhis head and the other banged the bamboo on the\nground. He would greet the lady of the house with\n“Good morning” and then place his basket on the\nvertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed aside\nwith a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered\nto the servant. But we would not give up. We would\nclimb a bench or the parapet and peep into the\nbasket, somehow. I can still recall the typical\nfragrance of those loaves. Loaves for the elders and\nthe bangles for the children. Then we did not even\ncare to brush our teeth or wash our mouths\nproperly. And why should we? Who would take the\ntrouble of plucking the mango-leaf for the\ntoothbrush?

Cakes and bolinhas are a must for\nChristmas as well as other festivals. Thus, the\npresence of the baker’s furnace in the village is\nabsolutely essential.\nThe baker or bread-seller of those days had a\npeculiar dress known as the kabai. It was a single-\npiece long frock reaching down to the knees. In our\nchildhood we saw bakers wearing a shirt and\ntrousers which were shorter than full-length ones\nand longer than half pants. Even today, anyone\nwho wears a half pant which reaches just below\nthe knees invites the comment that he is dressed\nlike a pader!\nThe baker usually collected his bills at the end\nof the month. Monthly accounts used to be recorded\non some wall in pencil. Baking was indeed a\nprofitable profession in the old days. The baker and\nhis family never starved. He, his family and his\nservants always looked happy and prosperous. Their\nplump physique was an open testimony to this.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \nParagraph (1) \n(ii) \nWhich of the following statements best describes the comparison \nmade in the sentence ? \n1 \n \n‘‘Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices.’’  \n(A) \nGold and saffron have similar physical properties. \n(B) \nGold and saffron have equal monetary value. \n(C) \nSaffron is considered the most valuable spice, similar to how \ngold is valued among metals.  \n(D) \nGold and saffron are both rare commodities in the global \nmarket.

With the ping-pong ball he invented a\ngame of his own which could keep him engrossed\nfor up to half an hour at a time. A suitcase that I\nhad taken to Iraq had become damaged on the\njourney home, so that the lid, when closed,\nremained at a slope from one end to the other. Mij\ndiscovered that if he placed the ball on the high\nend it would run down the length of the suitcase.\nHe would dash around to the other end to ambush\nits arrival, hide from it, crouching, to spring up\nand take it by surprise, grab it and trot off with it\nto the high end once more.\nOutside the house I exercised him on a lead,\nprecisely as if he had been a dog. Mij quickly developed\ncertain compulsive habits on these walks in the\nLondon streets, like the rituals of children who on\ntheir way to and from school must place their feet\nsquarely on the centre of each paving block; must\ntouch every seventh upright of the iron railings, or\npass to the outside of every second lamp post. Opposite\nto my flat was a single-storied primary school, along\nwhose frontage ran a low wall some two feet high.

Otters belong to\na comparatively small group of animals called\nMustellines, shared by the badger, mongoose, weasel,\nstoat, mink and others. I faced a continuous barrage\nof conjectural questions that sprayed all the\nMustellines but the otter; more random guesses hit\non ‘a baby seal’ and ‘a squirrel.’ ‘Is that a walrus,\nmister?’ reduced me to giggles, and outside a dog\nshow I heard ‘a hippo’. A beaver, a bear cub, a leopard\n— one, apparently, that had changed its spots —\nand a ‘brontosaur’; Mij was anything but an otter.\nBut the question for which I awarded the highest\nscore came from a labourer digging a hole in the street.\nI was still far from him when he laid down his tool,\nput his hands on his hips, and began to stare. As I\ndrew nearer I saw his expression of surprise and\naffront, as though he would have me know that he\nwas not one upon whom to play jokes.

Then lead students into\na discussion about the ethics of keeping wild animals as pets: What are the difficulties\nthese may entail? According to the students, what will the animal miss most when it\nis taken away from its natural habitat? Do they think that it is ‘cute’ to see Mij the\notter on a leash?

She was eight years old and very\ncurious about things. Her favourite pastime was\nstanding in the front doorway of her house,\nwatching what was happening in the street outside.\nThere were no playmates of her own age on her\nstreet, and this was about all she had to do.\nBut for Valli, standing at the front door was every\nbit as enjoyable as any of the elaborate games other\nchildren played.

It passed through her street each hour, once\ngoing to the town and once coming back. The sight\nof the bus, filled each time with a new set of\npassengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli.\nDay after day she watched the bus, and\ngradually a tiny wish crept into her head and\ngrew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even\nif just once. This wish became stronger and\nstronger, until it was an overwhelming desire.\nValli would stare wistfully at the people who got\non or off the bus when it stopped at the street\ncorner. Their faces would kindle in her longings,\ndreams, and hopes. If one of her friends happened\nto ride the bus and tried to describe the sights of\nthe town to her, Valli would be too jealous to listen\nand would shout, in English: “Proud! proud!”\nNeither she nor her friends really understood the\nmeaning of the word, but they used it often as a\nslang expression of disapproval.\nOver many days and months Valli listened\ncarefully to conversations between her neighbours\nand people who reg...[truncated]",

Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders.

From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east.

But suddenly she saw a young cow lying\ndead by the roadside, just where it had been struck\nby some fast-moving vehicle.\n“Isn’t that the same cow that ran in front of the\nbus on our trip to town?” she asked the conductor.\nThe conductor nodded, and she was overcome\nwith sadness. What had been a lovable, beautiful\ncreature just a little while ago had now suddenly\nlost its charm and its life and looked so horrible, so\nfrightening as it lay there, legs spreadeagled, a fixed\nstare in its lifeless eyes, blood all over...\nThe bus moved on.

And don’t forget to bring your fare.”\nShe laughed and jumped down from the bus.\nThen away she went, running straight for home.\nWhen she entered her house she found her\nmother awake and talking to one of Valli’s aunts,\nthe one from South Street. This aunt was a real\nchatterbox, never closing her mouth once she\nstarted talking.\n“And where have you been?” said her aunt when\nValli came in. She spoke very casually, not expecting\na reply. So Valli just smiled, and her mother and\naunt went on with their conversation.\n“Yes, you’re right,” her mother said. “So many\nthings in our midst and in the world outside. How\ncan we possibly know about everything? And even\nwhen we do know about something, we often can’t\nunderstand it completely, can we?”\n“Oh, yes!” breathed Valli.\n“What?” asked her mother. “What’s that you say?”\n“Oh,” said Valli, “I was just agreeing with what\nyou said about things happening without our\nknowledge.”\n“Just a chit of a girl, she is,” said her aunt, “and\nyet look how she pokes her nose into our conversation,\njust as though she were a grown lady.”\nValli smiled to herself.

Get them to make\na collage using as many as possible of the tickets collected, on a sheet of poster\npaper. This can then form the basis for many interesting activities: classification\naccording to type of tickets (for what?) or price (how much?), etc; the most desirable\ntickets, the tickets no one wants, etc. — let students think of more ways to classify\nthem.

You must be familiar with ballads that\nnarrate tales of courage or heroism. This poem is a humorous\nballad close to a parody.\nRead it aloud, paying attention to the rhythm.\nBelinda lived in a little white house,\nWith a little black kitten and a little grey mouse,\nAnd a little yellow dog and a little red wagon,\nAnd a realio, trulio, little pet dragon.\nNow the name of the little black kitten was Ink,\nAnd the little grey mouse, she called him Blink,\nAnd the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard,\nBut the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard.\nCustard the dragon had big sharp teeth,\nAnd spikes on top of him and scales underneath,\nMouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose,\nAnd realio, trulio daggers on his toes.\nBelinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears,\nAnd Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs,\nMustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage,\nBut Custard cried for a nice safe cage.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBelinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful,\nInk, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival,\nThey all sat laughing in the little red wagon\nAt the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon.\nBelinda giggled till she shook the house,\nAnd Blink said Weeck! which is giggling for a mouse,\nInk and Mustard rudely asked his age,\nWhen Custard cried for a nice safe cage.\nSuddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound,\nAnd Mustard growled, and they all looked around.\nMeowch! cried Ink, and ooh! cried Belinda,\nFor there was a pirate, climbing in the winda.\nPistol in his left hand, pistol in his right,\nAnd he held in his teeth a cutlass bright,\nHis beard was black, one leg was wood;\nIt was clear that the pirate meant no good.\nBelinda paled, and she cried Help! Help!\nBut Mustard fled with a terrified yelp,\nInk trickled down to the bottom of the household,\nAnd little mouse Blink strategically mouseholed.\nBut up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine,\nClashed his tail like irons in a dungeon,\nWith a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm,\nHe went at the pirate like a robin at a worm.\nThe pirate gaped at Belinda’s dragon,\nAnd gulped some grog from his pocket flagon,\nHe fired two bullets, but they didn’t hit,\nAnd Custard gobbled him, every bit.\nFirst Flight\n108\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBelinda embraced him, Mustard licked him,\nNo one mourned for his pirate victim.\nInk and Blink in glee did gyrate\nAround the dragon that ate the pirate.\nBut presently up spoke little dog Mustard,\nI’d have been twice as brave if I hadn’t been flustered.\nAnd up spoke Ink and up spoke Blink,\nWe’d have been three times as brave, we think,\nAnd Custard said, I quite agree\nThat everybody is braver than me.\nBelinda still lives in her little white house,\nWith her little black kitten and her little grey mouse,\nAnd her little yellow dog and her little red wagon,\nAnd her realio, trulio little pet dragon.\nBelinda is as brave as a barrel full of bears,\nAnd Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs,\nMustard is as brave as a tiger in a rage,\nBut Custard keeps crying for a nice safe cage.\nOGDEN NASH\nOgden Nash wrote over four hundred pieces of comic verse. The\nbest of his work was published in 14 volumes between 1931 and\n1972. His work is perhaps best described in this poetic tribute by\nAnthony Burgess:\n...he brought a new kind of sound to our literary diversions.\nAnd didn’t care much about breaking the poetic laws of the Medes\nand the Persians.\nHe uses lines, sometimes of considerable length that are colloquial\nand prosy.\nAnd at the end presents you with a rhyme...\nThis bringing together of the informal and the formal is what his\ngenius chiefly loves.\nI am trying to imitate him here, but he is probably quite inimitable.\nThe Tale of Custard the Dragon\n109\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFirst Flight\n110\ngrog: a drink typically drunk by sailors\ngyrate: to move around in circles\n1.\nWho are the characters in this poem? List them with their pet names.\n2.\nWhy did Custard cry for a nice safe cage?  Why is the dragon called “cowardly\ndragon”?\n3.\n“Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful...” Why?\n4.\nThe poet has employed many poetic devices in the poem. For example:\n“Clashed his tail like iron in a dungeon” — the poetic device here is a\nsimile. Can you, with your partner, list some more such poetic devices\nused in the poem?\n5.\nRead stanza three again to know how the poet describes the appearance of\nthe  dragon.\n6.\nCan you find out the rhyme scheme of two or three stanzas of the poem?\n7.\nWriters use words to give us a picture or image without actually saying what\nthey mean.

The\nBuddha preached his first sermon at the city of\nBenares, most holy of the dipping places on the River\nGanges; that sermon has been preserved and is given\nhere. It reflects the Buddha’s wisdom about one\ninscrutable kind of suffering.\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief\nshe carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking\nthem for medicine, and the people said, “She has lost\nher senses. The boy is dead.”\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her\nrequest, “I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I\nknow a physician who can.”\nAnd the girl said, “Pray tell me, sir; who is it?” And\nthe man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.”\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, “Lord\nand Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.”\nThe Buddha answered, “I want a handful of mustard-\nseed....[truncated]",

    "book_content": "115\nThe Sermon at Benares\nFeelings of Grief\nAlthough grief is unique and personal, a broad range of feelings and\nbehaviours are commonly experienced after the death of a loved one.\n•\nSadness. This is the most common, and it is not necessarily manifested\nby crying.\n•\nAnger. This is one of the most confusing feelings for a survivor. There\nmay be frustration at not being able to prevent the death, and a sense\nof not being able to exist without the loved one.\n•\nGuilt and Self-reproach. People may believe that they were not kind\nenough or caring enough to the person who died, or that the person\nshould have seen the doctor sooner.\n•\nAnxiety. An individual may fear that she/he won’t be able to care for\nherself/himself.\n•\nLoneliness. There are reminders throughout the day that a partner,\nfamily member or friend is gone. For example, meals are no longer\nprepared the same way, phone calls to share a special moment don’t\nhappen.\n•\nFatigue. There is an overall sense of feeling tired.\n•\nDisbelief: This occurs particularly if it was a sudden death.\nHelping Others Who Are Experiencing Grief\nWhen a friend, loved one, or co-worker is experiencing grief—how can we\nhelp? It helps to understand that grief is expressed through a variety of\nbehaviours.\nReach out to others in their grief, but understand that some may not\nwant to accept help and will not share their grief. Others will want to\ntalk about their thoughts and feelings or reminisce.\nBe patient and let the grieving person know that you care and are\nthere to support him or her.\nII. Good Grief\nAMITAI ETZIONI\nSoon after my wife died — her car slid off an icy road in 1985 — a school\npsychologist warned me that my children and I were not mourning in the\nright way. We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial.\nIn late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his\nsleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child.\nThere is no set form for grief, and no ‘right’ way to express it. There\nseems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress\nsystematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are\ntold, to jump to anger — or to wallow too long in this stage before moving\ntowards acceptance.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n116\nFirst Flight\nBut I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong;\nto have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel\nbeyond words.\nA relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by\nciting the maxim: ‘We are not to ask why, but what.’ The ‘what’ is that which\nsurvivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my\nfamily, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long\nanswers to simple questions like, “How did your day go today?” We try to\navoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take\nturns playing with Max, Michael’s two-year-old son. Friends spend nights\nwith the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the\nbaby is born.\nFocusing on what we do for one another is the only consolation we\ncan find.\nWrite a page (about three paragraphs) on one of the following topics. You can\nthink about the ideas in the text that are relevant to these topics, and add your\nown ideas and experiences to them.\n1.\nTeaching someone to understand a new or difficult idea\n2.\nHelping each other to get over difficult times\n3.\nThinking about oneself as unique, or as one among billions of others\nWHAT WE HAVE DONE\nNarrated the story of the Buddha, and the advice he gave to the grief-stricken woman.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n1.\nRead and discuss the following extract from Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet with the\nstudents.\nJoy and Sorrow\nThen a woman said, “Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.”\nAnd he answered:\nYour joy is your sorrow unmasked.\nAnd the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled\nwith your tears.\nAnd how else can it be?\nThe deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.\nIs not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the\npotter’s oven?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n117\nThe Sermon at Benares\nAnd is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed\nout with knives?\nWhen you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only\nthat which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.\nWhen you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in\ntruth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.\nSome of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow\nis the greater.”\nBut I say unto you, they are inseparable.\nTogether they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board,\nremember that the other is asleep upon your bed.\n2.\nHelp students to read and memorise the following extract from Tagore.\nSay not in grief that she is no more\nbut say in thankfulness that she was.\nA death is not the extinguishing of a light,\nbut the putting out of the\nlamp because the dawn has come.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFor Anne Gregory\nThis poem is a conversation between a young man and a young\nwoman. What are they arguing about?\n“Never shall a young man,\nThrown into despair\nBy those great honey-coloured\nRamparts at your ear,\nLove you for yourself alone\nAnd not your yellow hair.”\n“But I can get a hair-dye\nAnd set such colour there,\nBrown, or black, or carrot,\nThat young men in despair\nMay love me for myself alone\nAnd not my yellow hair.”\n“I heard an old religious man\nBut yesternight declare\nThat he had found a text to prove\nThat only God, my dear,\nCould love you for yourself alone\nAnd not your yellow hair.”\nWILLIAM BUTLER YEATS\nWilliam Butler Yeats (1865–1939) was an Irish nationalist. He was\neducated in London and Dublin, and was interested in folklore and\nmythology. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nramparts: the high, wide walls around a castle or fort, for example, the ramparts\nof the Red Fort\n1.\nWhat does the young man mean by “great honey-coloured /Ramparts at\nyour ear?” Why does he say that young men are “thrown into despair”\nby them?\n2.\nWhat colour is the young woman’s hair? What does she say she can change\nit to? Why would she want to do so?\n3.\nObjects have qualities which make them desirable to others. Can you think\nof some objects (a car, a phone, a dress…) and say what qualities make one\nobject more desirable than another? Imagine you were trying to sell an object:\nwhat qualities would you emphasise?\n4.\nWhat about people? Do we love others because we like their qualities, whether\nphysical or mental? Or is it possible to love someone “for themselves alone”?\nAre some people ‘more lovable’ than others? Discuss this question in pairs\nor in groups, considering points like the following.\n(i) a parent or caregiver’s love for a newborn baby, for a mentally or\nphysically challenged child, for a clever child or a prodigy\n(ii) the public’s love for a film star, a sportsperson, a politician, or a social\nworker\n(iii) your love for a friend, or brother or sister\n(iv) your love for a pet, and the pet’s love for you.\n5.\nYou have perhaps concluded that people are not objects to be valued for\ntheir qualities or riches rather than for themselves. But elsewhere Yeats\nasks the question: How can we separate the dancer from the dance? Is it\npossible to separate ‘the person himself or herself’ from how the person\nlooks, sounds, walks, and so on? Think of how you or a friend or member of\nyour family has changed over the years. Has your relationship also changed?\nIn what way?\n119\nFor Anne Gregory\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBEFORE YOU READ\nActivity\n1.\nThe word ‘proposal’ has several meanings. Can you guess what\nsort of proposal the play is about?\n(i) a suggestion, plan or scheme for doing something\n(ii) an offer for a possible plan or action\n(iii) the act of asking someone’s hand in marriage\nA Russian Wedding\nDo you know anything about a Russian marriage ceremony?\nRead this article about a Russian wedding.\nPreparations for a  Russian Wedding: A Russian wedding\nis very simple. The planning only includes arranging for\nrings, brides’ dress, cars, and a reception. Earlier, the bride’s\nfamily paid for the reception, but now-a-days brides’ and\ngrooms’ families usually share expenses. A Russian wedding\nlasts for two days; some weddings last as long as a week,\nand the occasion becomes something to remember for years.\nThe necessary part of the wedding ceremony is a wedding\nprocession of several cars. The best friends of the groom/\nbride meet before the wedding a few times, make posters,\nwrite speeches and organise contests. When the groom\narrives to fetch the bride for the registration, he has to fight\nto get her! Russians usually live in apartments in tall\nbuildings, and the groom has to climb several stairs to reach\nhis bride. But at each landing he must answer a question\nto be allowed to go up. The bride’s friends ask difficult\nquestions (sometimes about the bride, sometimes just\ndifficult riddles), and the groom must answer with the help\nof his friends. For example, he may be shown a few photos\nof baby girls and he must say which one his bride is. If he\nguesses wrong, he must pay cash to move ahead. After the\nReprint 2025-26\n\nWedding Ceremonies in Russia and India\nCustoms similar to\nCustoms different from\nIndian ones\nIndian ones\nmarriage registration, the newly-married couple leaves the\nguests for a tour of the city sights. After two or three hours\nof the city tour the couple arrives at the reception. The couple\nsits at a specially arranged table with their family, friends\nand invited guests. The reception starts with toasts to the\ncouple. A wedding toast is a custom where a close friend or\nrelative of the groom or the bride says a few words to wish\nthe couple, then everyone raises their glass of wine, and\ndrink it up at the same moment. The groom is then asked to\nkiss the bride. After a few toasts, people start eating and\ndrinking, and generally have fun. After some time, the bride\ngets ‘stolen’! She disappears, and when the groom starts\nlooking for her, he is asked to pay a fee. Usually it is his\nfriends who ‘steal’ the bride. Then there are the bride’s\nfriends — they steal the bride’s shoe. The groom must pay\nmoney for the shoe too. The guests enjoy watching these\ntussles, and continue partying.\n2.\nDo you think Indian and Russian weddings have any customs\nin common? With the help of a partner, fill in the table below.\n‘‘The Proposal’’ (originally titled ‘‘A Marriage Proposal’’) is a one-\nact play, a farce, by the Russian short story writer and dramatist\nAnton Chekhov.  It was written in 1888–89.\nThe play is about the tendency of wealthy families to seek ties\nwith other wealthy families, to increase their estates by encouraging\nmarriages that make good economic sense. Ivan Lomov, a long time\nwealthy neighbour of Stepan Chubukov, also wealthy, comes to\nseek the hand of Chubukov’s twenty-five-year-old daughter, Natalya.\nAll three are quarrelsome people, and they quarrel over petty issues.\nThe proposal is in danger of being forgotten amidst all this\nquarrelling. But economic good sense ensures that the proposal is\nmade, after all — although the quarrelling perhaps continues!\n121\nThe Proposal\nReprint 2025-26\n\n122\nFirst Flight\nCharacters\nSTEPAN STEPANOVITCH CHUBUKOV\n:\na landowner\nNATALYA STEPANOVNA\n:\nhis daughter, twenty-five years old\nIVAN VASSILEVITCH LOMOV\n:\na neighbour of Chubukov, a large and\nhearty, but very suspicious, landowner\nA drawing-room in Chubukov‘s house.\nLomov enters, wearing a dress-jacket and white gloves.

Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India.

    "book_content": "125\nThe Proposal\nhad the privilege of knowing your family. My late aunt\nand her husband, from whom, as you know, I inherited\nmy land, always had the greatest respect for your father\nand your late mother. The Lomovs and the Chubukovs\nhave always had the most friendly, and I might almost\nsay the most affectionate, regard for each other. And, as\nyou know, my land is a near neighbour of yours. You will\nremember that my Oxen Meadows touch your birchwoods.\nNATALYA\n: Excuse my interrupting you. You say, “my Oxen Meadows”.\nBut are they yours?\nLOMOV\n: Yes, mine.\nNATALYA\n: What are you talking about? Oxen Meadows are ours,\nnot yours!\nLOMOV\n: No, mine, honoured Natalya Stepanovna.\nNATALYA\n: Well, I never knew that before. How do you make that\nout?\nLOMOV\n: How? I’m speaking of those Oxen Meadows which are\nwedged in between your birchwoods and the Burnt\nMarsh.\nNATALYA\n: Yes, yes... they’re ours.\nLOMOV\n: No, you’re mistaken, honoured Natalya Stepanovna,\nthey’re mine.\nNATALYA\n: Just think, Ivan Vassilevitch! How long have they been\nyours?\nLOMOV\n: How long? As long as I can remember.\nNATALYA\n: Really, you won’t get me to believe that!\nLOMOV\n: But you can see from the documents, honoured Natalya\nStepanovna. Oxen Meadows, it’s true, were once the\nsubject of dispute, but now everybody knows that they\nare mine. There’s nothing to argue about. You see my\naunt’s grandmother gave the free use of these Meadows\nin perpetuity to the peasants of your father’s grandfather,\nin return for which they were to make bricks for her. The\npeasants belonging to your father’s grandfather had the\nfree use of the Meadows for forty years, and had got into\nthe habit of regarding them as their own, when it\nhappened that...\nNATALYA\n: No, it isn’t at all like that! Both grandfather and great-\ngrandfather reckoned that their land extended to Burnt\nMarsh — which means that Oxen Meadows were ours. I\ndon’t see what there is to argue about. It’s simply silly!\nReprint 2025-26\n\n126\nFirst Flight\nLOMOV\n: I’ll show you the documents, Natalya Stepanovna!\nNATALYA\n: No, you’re simply joking, or making fun of me. What a\nsurprise! We’ve had the land for nearly three hundred\nyears, and then we’re suddenly told that it isn’t ours!\nIvan Vassilevitch, I can hardly believe my own ears. These\nMeadows aren’t worth much to me. They only come to\nfive dessiatins, and are worth perhaps 300 roubles, but I\ncan’t stand unfairness. Say what you will, I can’t stand\nunfairness.\nLOMOV\n: Hear me out, I implore you! The peasants of your father’s\ngrandfather, as I have already had the honour of\nexplaining to you, used to bake bricks for my aunt’s\ngrandmother. Now my aunt’s grandmother, wishing to\nmake them a pleasant...\nNATALYA\n: I can’t make head or tail of all this about aunts and\ngrandfathers and grandmothers. The Meadows are ours,\nthat’s all.\nLOMOV\n: Mine.\nNATALYA\n: Ours! You can go on proving it for two days on end, you\ncan go and put on fifteen dress jackets, but I tell you\nthey’re ours, ours, ours! I don’t want anything of yours\nand I don’t want to give anything of mine. So there!\nLOMOV\n: Natalya Stepanovna, I don’t want the Meadows, but I am\nacting on principle. If you like, I’ll make you a present\nof them.\nNATALYA\n: I can make you a present of them myself, because they’re\nmine! Your behaviour, Ivan Vassilevitch, is strange, to\nsay the least! Up to this we have always thought of you\nas a good neighbour, a friend; last year we lent you our\nthreshing-machine, although on that account we had to\nput off our own threshing till November, but you behave\nto us as if we were gypsies. Giving me my own land,\nindeed! No, really, that’s not at all neighbourly! In my\nopinion, it’s even impudent, if you want to know.\nLOMOV\n: Then you make out that I’m a landgrabber? Madam, never\nin my life have I grabbed anybody else’s land and I shan’t\nallow anybody to accuse me of having done so. [Quickly\nsteps to the carafe and drinks more water] Oxen Meadows\nare mine!\nNATALYA\n: It’s not true, they’re ours!\nLOMOV\n: Mine!\nReprint 2025-26\n\n127\nThe Proposal\nNATALYA\n: It’s not true! I’ll prove it! I’ll send my mowers out to the\nMeadows this very day!\nLOMOV\n: What?\nNATALYA\n: My mowers will be there this very day!\nLOMOV\n: I’ll give it to them in the neck!\nNATALYA\n: You dare!\nLOMOV\n: [Clutches at his heart] Oxen Meadows are mine! You\nunderstand? Mine!\nNATALYA\n: Please don’t shout! You can shout yourself hoarse in your\nown house but here I must ask you to restrain yourself!\nLOMOV\n: If it wasn’t, madam, for this awful, excruciating\npalpitation, if my whole inside wasn’t upset, I’d talk to\nyou in a different way! [Yells] Oxen Meadows are mine!\nNATALYA\n: Ours!\nLOMOV\n: Mine!\nNATALYA\n: Ours!\nLOMOV\n: Mine!\n[Enter Chubukov]\nCHUBUKOV : What’s the matter? What are you shouting for?\nNATALYA\n: Papa, please tell this gentleman who owns Oxen\nMeadows, we or he?\nCHUBUKOV : [to Lomov] Darling, the Meadows are ours!\nReprint 2025-26\n\n128\nFirst Flight\nLOMOV\n: But, please, Stepan Stepanovitch, how can they be yours?\nDo be a reasonable man! My aunt’s grandmother gave\nthe Meadows for the temporary and free use of your\ngrandfather’s peasants. The peasants used the land for\nforty years and got accustomed to it as if it was their\nown, when it happened that...\nCHUBUKOV : Excuse me, my precious. You forget just this, that the\npeasants didn’t pay your grandmother and all that,\nbecause the Meadows were in dispute, and so on. And\nnow everybody knows that they’re ours. It means that\nyou haven’t seen the plan.\nLOMOV\n: I’ll prove to you that they’re mine!\nCHUBUKOV : You won’t prove it, my darling —\nLOMOV\n: I shall\nCHUBUKOV : Dear one, why yell like that? You won’t prove anything\njust by yelling. I don’t want anything of yours, and don’t\nintend to give up what I have. Why should I? And you\nknow, my beloved, that if you propose to go on arguing\nabout it, I’d much sooner give up the Meadows to the\npeasants than to you. There!\nLOMOV\n: I don’t understand! How have you the right to give away\nsomebody else’s property?\nCHUBUKOV : You may take it that I know whether I have the right or\nnot. Because, young man, I’m not used to being spoken\nto in that tone of voice, and so on. I, young man, am\ntwice your age, and ask you to speak to me without\nagitating yourself, and all that.\nLOMOV\n: No, you just think I’m a fool and want to have me on! You\ncall my land yours, and then you want me to talk to you\ncalmly and politely! Good neighbours don’t behave like\nthat, Stepan Stepanovitch! You’re not a neighbour, you’re\na grabber!\nCHUBUKOV : What’s that? What did you say?\nNATALYA\n: Papa, send the mowers out to the Meadows at once!\nCHUBUKOV : What did you say, sir?\nNATALYA\n: Oxen Meadows are ours, and I shan’t give them up, shan’t\ngive them up, shan’t give them up!\nLOMOV\n: We’ll see! I’ll have the matter taken to court, and then I’ll\nshow you!\nCHUBUKOV : To court? You can take it to court, and all that! You can!\nI know you; you’re just on the look-out for a chance to go\nReprint 2025-26\n\n129\nThe Proposal\nto court, and all that. You pettifogger! All your people\nwere like that! All of them!\nLOMOV\n: Never mind about my people! The Lomovs have all been\nhonourable people, and not one has ever been tried for\nembezzlement, like your grandfather!\nCHUBUKOV : You Lomovs have had lunacy in your family, all of you!\nNATALYA\n: All, all, all!\nCHUBUKOV : Your grandfather was a drunkard, and your younger aunt,\nNastasya Mihailovna, ran away with an architect, and\nso on...\nLOMOV\n: And your mother was hump-backed. [Clutches at his heart]\nSomething pulling in my side... My head.... Help!

You’re an intriguer....Oh,\nmy heart! And it’s an open secret that before the last\nelections you bri... I can see stars... Where’s my hat?\nNATALYA\n: It’s low! It’s dishonest!

My foot’s quite numb...\n[Goes to the door.]\nCHUBUKOV : [following him] And don’t set foot in my house again!\nNATALYA\n: Take it to court!

What trust can one have in one’s\nneighbours after that!\nCHUBUKOV : The villain! The scarecrow!\nNATALYA\n: The monster! First he takes our land and then he has\nthe impudence to abuse us.\nCHUBUKOV : And that blind hen, yes, that turnip-ghost has the\nconfounded cheek to make a proposal, and so on! What?\nA proposal!\nNATALYA\n: What proposal?\nCHUBUKOV : Why, he came here to propose to you.\nNATALYA\n: To propose? To me? Why didn’t you tell me so before?\nCHUBUKOV : So he dresses up in evening clothes. The stuffed sausage!\nThe wizen-faced frump!\nReprint 2025-26\n\n130\nFirst Flight\nNATALYA\n: To propose to me? Ah! [Falls into an easy-chair and wails]\nBring him back! Back! Ah! Bring him here.\nCHUBUKOV : Bring whom here?\nNATALYA\n: Quick, quick! I’m ill! Fetch him!\n[Hysterics.]\nCHUBUKOV : What’s that? What’s the matter with you? [Clutches at\nhis head] Oh, unhappy man that I am! I’ll shoot myself!\nI’ll hang myself! We’ve done for her!\nNATALYA\n: I’m dying! Fetch him!\nCHUBUKOV : Tfoo! At once. Don’t yell!\n[Runs out. A pause.]\nNATALYA\n: [Natalya Stepanovna wails.] What have they done to me?\nFetch him back! Fetch him!\n[A pause. Chubukov runs in.]\nCHUBUKOV : He’s coming, and so on, devil take him! Ouf! Talk to him\nyourself; I don’t want to...\nNATALYA\n: [wails] Fetch him!\nCHUBUKOV : [yells] He’s coming, I tell you. Oh, what a burden, Lord, to\nbe the father of a grown-up daughter! I’ll cut my throat I\nwill, indeed! We cursed him, abused him, drove him out;\nand it’s all you... you!\nNATALYA\n: No, it was you!\nCHUBUKOV : I tell you it’s not my fault. [Lomov appears at the door]\nNow you talk to him yourself.\n[Exit.]\nLOMOV\n: [Lomov enters, exhausted.] My heart’s palpitating awfully.\nMy foot’s gone to sleep. There’s something that keeps\npulling in my side....\nNATALYA\n: Forgive us, Ivan Vassilevitch, we were all a little heated.\nI remember now: Oxen Meadows... really are yours.\nLOMOV\n: My heart’s beating awfully. My Meadows... My eyebrows\nare both twitching....\nNATALYA\n: The Meadows are yours, yes, yours. Do sit down. [They\nsit] We were wrong.\nLOMOV\n: I did it on principle. My land is worth little to me, but the\nprinciple...\nNATALYA\n: Yes, the principle, just so. Now let’s talk of something else.\nLOMOV\n: The more so as I have evidence. My aunt’s grandmother\ngave the land to your father’s grandfather’s peasants...\nNATALYA\n: Yes, yes, let that pass. [aside] I wish I knew how to get\nhim started. [aloud] Are you going to start shooting soon?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n131\nThe Proposal\nLOMOV\n: I’m thinking of having a go at the blackcock, honoured\nNatalya Stepanovna, after the harvest. Oh, have you\nheard? Just think, what a misfortune I’ve had! My dog\nGuess, who you know, has gone lame.\nNATALYA\n: What a pity! Why?\nLOMOV\n: I don’t know. Must have got his leg twisted or bitten by\nsome other dog. [sighs] My very best dog, to say nothing\nof the expense. I gave Mironov 125 roubles for him.\nNATALYA\n: It was too much, Ivan Vassilevitch.\nLOMOV\n: I think it was very cheap. He’s a first-rate dog.\nNATALYA\n: Papa gave 85 roubles for his Squeezer, and Squeezer is\nheaps better than Guess!\nLOMOV\n: Squeezer better than Guess? What an idea! [laughs]\nSqueezer better than Guess!\nNATALYA\n: Of course he’s better! Of course, Squeezer is young, he\nmay develop a bit, but on points and pedigree he’s better\nthan anything that even Volchanetsky has got.\nLOMOV\n: Excuse me, Natalya Stepanovna, but you forget that he\nis overshot, and an overshot always means the dog is a\nbad hunter!\nNATALYA\n: Overshot, is he? The first time I hear it!\nLOMOV\n: I assure you that his lower jaw is shorter than the upper.\nNATALYA\n: Have you measured?\nLOMOV\n: Yes. He’s all right at following, of course, but if you want\nto get hold of anything...\nNATALYA\n: In the first place, our Squeezer is a thoroughbred animal,\nthe son of Harness and Chisels while there’s no getting\nat the pedigree of your dog at all. He’s old and as ugly as\na worn-out cab-horse.\nLOMOV\n: He is old, but I wouldn’t take five Squeezers for him.\nWhy, how can you? Guess is a dog; as for Squeezer, well,\nit’s too funny to argue. Anybody you like has a dog as\ngood as Squeezer... you may find them under every bush\nalmost. Twenty-five roubles would be a handsome price\nto pay for him.\nNATALYA\n: There’s some demon of contradition in you today, Ivan\nVassilevitch. First you pretend that the Meadows are\nyours; now, that Guess is better than Squeezer. I don’t\nlike people who don’t say what they mean, because\nyou know perfectly well that Squeezer is a hundred\ntimes better than your silly Guess. Why do you want\nto say he isn’t?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n132\nFirst Flight\nLOMOV\n: I see, Natalya Stepanovna, that you consider me either\nblind or a fool. You must realise that Squeezer is overshot!\nNATALYA\n: It’s not true.\nLOMOV\n: He is!\nNATALYA\n: It’s not true!\nLOMOV\n: Why shout madam?\nNATALYA\n: Why talk rot? It’s awful! It’s time your Guess was shot,\nand you compare him with Squeezer!\nLOMOV\n: Excuse me, I cannot continue this discussion, my heart\nis palpitating.\nNATALYA\n: I’ve noticed that those hunters argue most who know least.\nLOMOV\n: Madam, please be silent. My heart is going to pieces.\n[shouts] Shut up!\nNATALYA\n: I shan’t shut up until you acknowledge that Squeezer is\na hundred times better than your Guess!\nLOMOV\n: A hundred times worse! Be hanged to your Squeezer! His\nhead... eyes... shoulder...\nNATALYA\n: There’s no need to hang your silly Guess; he’s half-dead\nalready!\nLOMOV\n: [weeps] Shut up! My heart’s bursting!\nNATALYA\n: I shan’t shut up.\n[Enter Chubukov.]\nCHUBUKOV : What’s the matter now?\nNATALYA\n: Papa, tell us truly, which is the better dog, our Squeezer\nor his Guess.\nLOMOV\n: Stepan Stepanovitch, I implore you to tell me just one\nthing: is your Squeezer overshot or not? Yes or no?\nCHUBUKOV : And suppose he is? What does it matter? He’s the best dog\nin the district for all that, and so on.\nLOMOV\n: But isn’t my Guess better? Really, now?\nCHUBUKOV : Don’t excite yourself, my precious one. Allow me. Your\nGuess certainly has his good points. He’s purebred, firm\non his feet, has well-sprung ribs, and all that. But, my\ndear man, if you want to know the truth, that dog has\ntwo defects: he’s old and he’s short in the muzzle.\nLOMOV\n: Excuse me, my heart... Let’s take the facts. You will\nremember that on the Marusinsky hunt my Guess ran\nneck-and-neck with the Count’s dog, while your Squeezer\nwas left a whole verst behind.\nCHUBUKOV : He got left behind because the Count’s whipper-in hit\nhim with his whip.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n133\nThe Proposal\nLOMOV\n: And with good reason.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \nParagraph (1) \n(ii) \nWhich of the following statements best describes the comparison \nmade in the sentence ? \n1 \n \n‘‘Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices.’’  \n(A) \nGold and saffron have similar physical properties. \n(B) \nGold and saffron have equal monetary value. \n(C) \nSaffron is considered the most valuable spice, similar to how \ngold is valued among metals.  \n(D) \nGold and saffron are both rare commodities in the global \nmarket.

The\ninauguration would be the largest gathering ever of\ninternational leaders on South African soil.\nThe ceremonies took place in the lovely\nsandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union\nBuildings in Pretoria.

What does he mean by this? What is the “glorious …\nhuman achievement” he speaks of at the end?\n4.\nWhat does Mandela thank the international leaders for?\n5.\nWhat ideals does he set out for the future of South Africa?\nA few moments later we all lifted our eyes in\nawe as a spectacular array of South African jets,\nhelicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect\nformation over the Union Buildings. It was not only\na display of pinpoint precision and military force,\nbut a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to\ndemocracy, to a new government that had been\nfreely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the\nhighest generals of the South African defence force\nand police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and\nmedals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged\ntheir loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that\nnot so many years before they would not have\nsaluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala\njets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue\nand gold of the new South African flag.\nThe day was symbolised for me by the playing of\nour two national anthems, and the vision of whites\nsinging ‘Nkosi Sikelel –iAfrika’ and blacks singing\n‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although\nthat day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem\nthey once despised, they would soon know the\nwords by heart.\nOn the day of the inauguration, I was\noverwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first\ndecade of the twentieth century, a few years after\nthe bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,\nthe white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched\nup their differences and erected a system of racial\ndomination against the dark-skinned peoples of their\nown land. The structure they created formed the\nbasis of one of the harshest, most inhumane,\nsocieties the world has ever known. Now, in the\nlast decade of the twentieth century, and my own\neighth decade as a man, that system had been\nnot unmindful of\nconscious of; aware of\nchevron\na pattern in the\nshape of a V\ndespised\nhad a very low\nopinion of\nspectacular array\nan impressive\ndisplay (colourful\nand attractive)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n20\nFirst Flight\nwrought (old\nfashioned, formal\nword)\ndone, achieved\nprofound\ndeep and strong\n* These are some prominent names in the struggle against apartheid.\n(For the use of the definite article with proper nouns, see exercise II on page 25)\nYusuf Dadoo\nBram Fischer\nChief Luthuli\nOliver Tambo\nWalter Sisulu\nRobert Sobukwe\noverturned forever and replaced by one that\nrecognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples,\nregardless of the colour of their skin.\nThat day had come about through the\nunimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,\npeople whose suffering and courage can never be\ncounted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so\nmany other days, that I was simply the sum of all\nthose African patriots who had gone before me. That\nlong and noble line ended and now began again\nwith me. I was pained that I was not able to thank\nthem and that they were not able to see what their\nsacrifices had wrought.\nThe policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting\nwound in my country and my people. All of us will\nspend many years, if not generations, recovering\nfrom that profound hurt. But the decades of\noppression and brutality had another, unintended,\neffect, and that was that it produced the Oliver\nTambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the\nYusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert\nSobukwes of our time* — men of such extraordinary\nReprint 2025-26\n\n21\nNelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\ncourage, wisdom and generosity that their like may\nnever be known again. Perhaps it requires such\ndepths of oppression to create such heights of\ncharacter. My country is rich in the minerals and\ngems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always\nknown that its greatest wealth is its people, finer\nand truer than the purest diamonds.\nIt is from these comrades in the struggle that I\nlearned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I\nhave seen men and women risk and give their lives\nfor an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks\nand torture without breaking, showing a strength\nand resilience that defies the imagination. I learned\nthat courage was not the absence of fear, but the\ntriumph over it. The brave man is not he who does\nnot feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.\nNo one is born hating another person because of\nthe colour of his skin, or his background, or his\nreligion. People must learn to hate, and if they can\nlearn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love\ncomes more naturally to the human heart than its\nopposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when\nmy comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would\nsee a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards,\nperhaps just for a second, but it was enough to\nreassure me and keep me going. Man’s goodness is\na flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.\nOral Comprehension Check\n1.\nWhat do the military generals do?

But\nin a country like South Africa, it was almost\nimpossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil\nboth of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of\ncolour who attempted to live as a human being was\npunished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who\ntried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably\nripped from his family and his home and was forced\nto live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy\nand rebellion.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders.

Here are two stories about flying.\nI. A young seagull is afraid to fly. How does he conquer his fear?\nII. A pilot is lost in storm clouds. Does he arrive safe? Who helps\nhim?\nI\nHis First Flight\nTHE young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two\nbrothers and his sister had already flown away the\nday before. He had been afraid to fly with them.\nSomehow when he had taken a little run forward to\nthe brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his\nwings he became afraid. The great expanse of sea\nstretched down beneath, and it was such a long\nway down — miles down. He felt certain that his\nwings would never support him; so he bent his head\nand ran away back to the little hole under the ledge\nwhere he slept at night. Even when each of his\nbrothers and his little sister, whose wings were far\nshorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their\nwings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage\nto take that plunge which appeared to him so\ndesperate. His father and mother had come around\nledge\na narrow horizontal\nshelf projecting from\na wall or (here) a cliff\nReprint 2025-26\n\ncalling to him shrilly, upbraiding him, threatening\nto let him starve on his ledge unless he flew away.\nBut for the life of him he could not move.\nThat was twenty-four hours ago. Since then\nnobody had come near him. The day before, all day\nlong, he had watched his parents flying about with\nhis brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art\nof flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and\nhow to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older\nbrother catch his first herring and devour it,\nstanding on a rock, while his parents circled around\nraising a proud cackle. And all the morning the\nwhole family had walked about on the big plateau\nmidway down the opposite cliff taunting him with\nhis cowardice.\nThe sun was now ascending the sky, blazing on\nhis ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat\nbecause he had not eaten since the previous nightfall.\nHe stepped slowly out to the brink of the ledge,\nand standing on one leg with the other leg hidden\nunder his wing, he closed one eye, then the other,\nherring\na soft-finned sea fish\n(to) skim\nto move lightly just\nabove a surface\n(here, the sea)\nupbraiding\nscolding\n33\nTwo Stories about Flying\nReprint 2025-26\n\n34\nFirst Flight\nand pretended to be falling asleep. Still they took\nno notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his\nsister lying on the plateau dozing with their heads\nsunk into their necks. His father was preening the\nfeathers on his white back. Only his mother was\nlooking at him. She was standing on a little high\nhump on the plateau, her white breast thrust\nforward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish\nthat lay at her feet and then scrapped each side of\nher beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened\nhim. How he loved to tear food that way, scrapping\nhis beak now and again to whet it.\n“Ga, ga, ga,” he cried begging her to bring him\nsome food. “Gaw-col-ah,” she screamed back\nderisively. But he kept calling plaintively, and\nafter a minute or so he uttered a joyful scream.\nHis mother had picked up a piece of the fish and\nwas flying across to him with it.

But when\nshe was just opposite to him, she halted, her\nwings motionless, the piece of fish in her beak\nalmost within reach of his beak. He waited a\nmoment in surprise, wondering why she did not\ncome nearer, and then, maddened by hunger, he\ndived at the fish. With a loud scream he fell\noutwards and downwards into space. Then a\nmonstrous terror seized him and his heart stood\nstill. He could hear nothing. But it only lasted a\nminute. The next moment he felt his wings spread\noutwards. The wind rushed against his breast\nfeathers, then under his stomach, and against his\nwings. He could feel the tips of his wings cutting\nthrough the air. He was not falling headlong now.\nHe was soaring gradually downwards and outwards.\nHe was no longer afraid. He just felt a bit dizzy.\nThen he flapped his wings once and he soared\nupwards. “Ga, ga, ga, Ga, ga, ga, Gaw-col-ah,” his\nmother swooped past him, her wings making a\nloud noise. He answered her with another scream.\nThen his father flew over him screaming. He saw\nhis two brothers and his sister flying around him\ncurveting and banking and soaring and diving.\nThen he completely forgot that he had not always\nbeen able to fly, and commended himself to dive\nand soar and curve, shrieking shrilly.\nHe was near the sea now, flying straight over\nit, facing straight out over the ocean. He saw a\nvast green sea beneath him, with little ridges\nmoving over it and he turned his beak sideways\nand cawed amusedly.\nHis parents and his brothers and sister had\nlanded on this green flooring ahead of him. They\nwere beckoning to him, calling shrilly. He dropped\nhis legs to stand on the green sea. His legs sank\ninto it. He screamed with fright and attempted to\nrise again flapping his wings. But he was tired and\nweak with hunger and he could not rise, exhausted\ndizzy\nan uncomfortable\nfeeling of spinning\naround and losing\none’s balance\ncurveting\nleaping like a horse\nbanking\nflying with one wing\nhigher than the other\nReprint 2025-26\n\n36\nFirst Flight\n1.\nWhy was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are\nafraid to make their first flight, or are some birds more timid than others?\nDo you think a human baby also finds it a challenge to take its first steps?\n2.\n“The sight of the food maddened him.” What does this suggest? What\ncompelled the young seagull to finally fly?\n3.\n“They were beckoning to him, calling shrilly.” Why did the seagull’s father\nand mother threaten him and cajole him to fly?\n4.\nHave you ever had a similar experience, where your parents encouraged\nyou to do something that you were too scared to try? Discuss this in pairs\nor groups.\n5.\nIn the case of a bird flying, it seems a natural act, and a foregone conclusion\nthat it should succeed. In the examples you have given in answer to the\nprevious question, was your success guaranteed, or was it important for\nyou to try, regardless of a possibility of failure?\nWe have just read about the first flight of a young seagull.

I was happy to be\nalone high up above the sleeping countryside. I was\nflying my old Dakota aeroplane over France back to\nEngland. I was dreaming of my holiday and looking\nforward to being with my family. I looked at my\nwatch: one thirty in the morning.\n‘I should call Paris Control soon,’ I thought. As I\nlooked down past the nose of the aeroplane, I saw\nthe lights of a big city in front of me. I switched on\nthe radio and said, “Paris Control, Dakota DS 088\nhere. Can you hear me? I’m on my way to England.\nOver.”\nThe voice from the radio answered me immediately:\n“DS 088, I can hear you. You ought to turn twelve\ndegrees west now, DS 088. Over.”\nI checked the map and the compass, switched\nover to my second and last fuel tank, and turned\nthe Dakota twelve degrees west towards England.\n‘I’ll be in time for breakfast,’ I thought. A good\nbig English breakfast! Everything was going well —\nit was an easy flight.\nParis was about 150 kilometres behind me when\nI saw the clouds. Storm clouds. They were huge.\nThey looked like black mountains standing in front\nof me across the sky. I knew I could not fly up and\nover them, and I did not have enough fuel to fly\naround them to the north or south.\n“I ought to go back to Paris,” I thought, but I\nwanted to get home. I wanted that breakfast.\n‘I’ll take the risk,’ I thought, and flew that old\nDakota straight into the storm.\nInside the clouds, everything was suddenly black.\nIt was impossible to see anything outside the\naeroplane. The old aeroplane jumped and twisted\nin the air. I looked at the compass. I couldn’t believe\nReprint 2025-26\n\n38\nFirst Flight\nmy eyes: the compass was turning round and round\nand round. It was dead. It would not work! The\nother instruments were suddenly dead, too. I tried\nthe radio.\n“Paris Control? Paris Control? Can you hear me?”\nThere was no answer. The radio was dead too. I\nhad no radio, no compass, and I could not see where\nI was. I was lost in the storm. Then, in the black\nclouds quite near me, I saw another aeroplane. It\nhad no lights on its wings, but I could see it flying\nnext to me through the storm. I could see the pilot’s\nface — turned towards me. I was very glad to see\nanother person. He lifted one hand and waved.\n“Follow me,” he was saying. “Follow me.”\n‘He knows that I am lost,’ I thought. ‘He’s trying\nto help me.’\nHe turned his aeroplane slowly to the north, in\nfront of my Dakota, so that it would be easier for\nme to follow him. I was very happy to go behind the\nstrange aeroplane like an obedient child.\nAfter half an hour the strange black aeroplane\nwas still there in front of me in the clouds. Now\nReprint 2025-26\n\n39\nTwo Stories about Flying\nthere was only enough fuel in the old Dakota’s last\ntank to fly for five or ten minutes more. I was\nstarting to feel frightened again. But then he started\nto go down and I followed through the storm.\nSuddenly I came out of the clouds and saw two\nlong straight lines of lights in front of me. It was a\nrunway! An airport! I was safe! I turned to look for\nmy friend in the black aeroplane, but the sky was\nempty. There was nothing there. The black\naeroplane was gone. I could not see it anywhere.\nI landed and was not sorry to walk away from the\nold Dakota near the control tower. I went and asked\na woman in the control centre where I was and who\nthe other pilot was. I wanted to say ‘Thank you’.\nShe looked at me very strangely, and then\nlaughed.\n“Another aeroplane? Up there in this storm? No\nother aeroplanes were flying tonight. Yours was the\nonly one I could see on the radar.”\nSo who helped me to arrive there safely without\na compass or a radio, and without any more fuel in\nmy tanks?

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \nParagraph (1) \n(ii) \nWhich of the following statements best describes the comparison \nmade in the sentence ? \n1 \n \n‘‘Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices.’’  \n(A) \nGold and saffron have similar physical properties. \n(B) \nGold and saffron have equal monetary value. \n(C) \nSaffron is considered the most valuable spice, similar to how \ngold is valued among metals.  \n(D) \nGold and saffron are both rare commodities in the global \nmarket.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/2 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \n \n            ...[truncated]"

Her\nfamily had moved to Amsterdam\nafter the Nazis gained power in\nGermany but were trapped when\nthe Nazi occupation extended into\nthe Netherlands. As persecutions\nagainst the Jewish population\nincreased, the family went into\nhiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank’s\noffice building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed\nand transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died\nof typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank.\nHer father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam\nafter the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced\nthat it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in\nEnglish under the name The Diary of a Young Girl.\nThe diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday\nand chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its\nfinal entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its\noriginal Dutch into many languages and became one of the world’s\nmost widely read books. There have also been several films,\ntelevision and theatrical productions, and even an opera, based on\nthe diary. Described as the work of a mature and insightful mind,\nthe diary provides an intimate examination of daily life under Nazi\noccupation. Anne Frank has become one of the most renowned and\ndiscussed of the Holocaust victims.\n“This is a photo as I would wish\nmyself to look all the time. Then\nI would, maybe, have a chance\nto come to Hollywood.”\n– Anne Frank, 10 October 1942\nReprint 2025-26\n\n2.\nHere are some entries from personal records. Use the definitions\nabove to decide which of the entries might be from a diary, a\njournal, a log or a memoir.\n(i) I woke up very late today and promptly got a scolding from\nMum!

Given below under ‘A’ are some terms we\nuse to describe a written record of personal experience. Can\nyou match them with their descriptions under ‘B’? (You may\nlook up the terms in a dictionary if you wish.)\nB\n– A book with a separate space or page for each\nday, in which you write down your thoughts\nand feelings or what has happened on that day\n– A full record of a journey, a period of time, or\nan event, written every day\n– A record of a person’s own life and experiences\n(usually, a famous person)\n– A written record of events with times and\ndates, usually official\nA\n(i) Journal\n(ii) Diary\n(iii) Log\n(iv) Memoir(s)\nReprint 2025-26\n\n50\nFirst Flight\nWRITING in a diary is a really strange experience for\nsomeone like me. Not only because I’ve never written\nanything before, but also because it seems to me\nthat later on neither I nor anyone else will be\ninterested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old\nschoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn’t matter. I feel like\nwriting, and I have an even greater need to get all\nkinds of things off my chest.\n‘Paper has more patience than people.’ I thought\nof this saying on one of those days when I was feeling\na little depressed and was sitting at home with my\nchin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering\nwhether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I\nwas, brooding: Yes, paper does have more patience,\nand since I’m not planning to let anyone else read\nthis stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a\n‘diary’, unless I should ever find a real friend, it\nprobably won’t make a bit of difference.\nNow I’m back to the point that prompted me\nto keep a diary in the first place: I don’t have a\nfriend.\nLet me put it more clearly, since no one will\nbelieve that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely\nalone in the world. And I’m not. I have loving parents\nand a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about\nthirty people I can call friends. I have a family,\nloving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I\nseem to have everything, except my one true friend.\nAll I think about when I’m with friends is having a\ngood time. I can’t bring myself to talk about anything\nbut ordinary everyday things. We don’t seem to be\nable to get any closer, and that’s the problem. Maybe\nit’s my fault that we don’t confide in each other. In\nany case, that’s just how things are, and\nunfortunately they’re not liable to change. This is\nwhy I’ve started the diary.\nTo enhance the image of this long-awaited friend\nin my imagination, I don’t want to jot down the\nfacts in this diary the way most people would do,\nbut I want the diary to be my friend, and I’m going\nto call this friend ‘Kitty’.\nlistless\nwith no  energy or\ninterest\nconfide\nto tell personal\nthings privately to a\nperson that one\ntrusts\nReprint 2025-26\n\n51\nFrom the Diary of Anne Frank\nOral Comprehension Check\n1.\nWhat makes writing in a diary a strange experience for Anne Frank?\n2.\nWhy does Anne want to keep a diary?\n3.\nWhy did Anne think she could confide more in her diary than in people?\nSince no one would understand a word of my\nstories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I’d better\nprovide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike\ndoing so.\nMy father, the most adorable father I’ve ever seen,\ndidn’t marry my mother until he was thirty-six and\nshe was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born\nin Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12\nJune 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My\nfather emigrated to Holland in 1933. My mother,\nEdith Hollander Frank, went with him to Holland\nin September, while Margot and I were sent to\nAachen to stay with our grandmother. Margot went\nto Holland in December, and I followed in February,\nwhen I was plunked down on the table as a birthday\npresent for Margot.\nI started right away at the Montessori nursery\nschool. I stayed there until I was six, at which time\nI started in the first form. In the sixth form my\nteacher was Mrs Kuperus, the headmistress. At the\nend of the year we were both in tears as we said a\nheartbreaking farewell.\nIn the summer of 1941 Grandma fell ill and had\nto have an operation, so my birthday passed with\nlittle celebration.\nGrandma died in January 1942. No one knows\nhow often I think of her and still love her. This\nbirthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make\nup for the other, and Grandma’s candle was lit along\nwith the rest.\nThe four of us are still doing well, and that brings\nme to the present date of 20 June 1942, and the\nsolemn dedication of my diary.\nOral Comprehension Check\n1.\nWhy does Anne provide a brief sketch of her life?\n2.\nWhat tells you that Anne loved her grandmother?\nplunked down (an\ninformal word)\nput down in a casual\nway\nReprint 2025-26\n\n52\nFirst Flight\nSaturday, 20 June 1942\nDearest Kitty,\nOur entire class is quaking in its boots. The\nreason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in\nwhich the teachers decide who’ll move up to the\nnext form and who’ll be kept back. Half the class is\nmaking bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the\ntwo boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have\nstaked their entire holiday savings on their bet.\nFrom morning to night, it’s “You’re going to pass”,\n“No, I’m not”, “Yes, you are”, “No, I’m not”. Even G.’s\npleading glances and my angry outbursts can’t calm\nthem down. If you ask me, there are so many\ndummies that about a quarter of the class should\nbe kept back, but teachers are the most\nunpredictable creatures on earth.\nI’m not so worried about my girlfriends and\nmyself. We’ll make it. The only subject I’m not sure\nabout is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until\nthen, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.\nI get along pretty well with all my teachers. There\nare nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr\nKeesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was\nannoyed with me for ages because I talked so much.\nAfter several warnings, he assigned me extra\nhomework. An essay on the subject, ‘A Chatterbox’.\nA chatterbox — what can you write about that? I’d\nworry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the\ntitle in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried\nto keep quiet.\nThat evening, after I’d finished the rest of my\nhomework, the note about the essay caught my eye.\nI began thinking about the subject while chewing\nthe tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on\nand leave big spaces between the words, but the\ntrick was to come up with convincing arguments to\nprove the necessity of talking. I thought and\nthought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the\nthree pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was\nsatisfied. I argued that talking is a student’s trait\nand that I would do my best to keep it under control,\nold fogey\nan old-fashioned\nperson\nram...[truncated]",

Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/2 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \n \n            ...[truncated]"

These bakers are, even today,\nknown as pader in Goa.\nDuring our childhood in Goa, the baker used to\nbe our friend, companion and guide. He used to\ncome at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in\nthe morning on his selling round, and then again,\nwhen he returned after emptying his huge basket.\nThe jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from\nsleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was\nit so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The\nloaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine,\nthe maid-servant of the house! What we longed for\nwere those bread-bangles which we chose carefully.\nSometimes it was sweet bread of special make.\nThe baker made his musical entry on the scene\nwith the ‘jhang, jhang’ sound of his specially made\nbamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on\nhis head and the other banged the bamboo on the\nground. He would greet the lady of the house with\n“Good morning” and then place his basket on the\nvertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed aside\nwith a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered\nto the servant. But we would not give up. We would\nclimb a bench or the parapet and peep into the\nbasket, somehow. I can still recall the typical\nfragrance of those loaves. Loaves for the elders and\nthe bangles for the children. Then we did not even\ncare to brush our teeth or wash our mouths\nproperly. And why should we? Who would take the\ntrouble of plucking the mango-leaf for the\ntoothbrush?

Not enough can be\nsaid to show how important a baker can be for a\nvillage. The lady of the house must prepare\nsandwiches on the occasion of her daughter’s\nengagement. Cakes and bolinhas are a must for\nChristmas as well as other festivals. Thus, the\npresence of the baker’s furnace in the village is\nabsolutely essential.\nThe baker or bread-seller of those days had a\npeculiar dress known as the kabai. It was a single-\npiece long frock reaching down to the knees. In our\nchildhood we saw bakers wearing a shirt and\ntrousers which were shorter than full-length ones\nand longer than half pants. Even today, anyone\nwho wears a half pant which reaches just below\nthe knees invites the comment that he is dressed\nlike a pader!\nThe baker usually collected his bills at the end\nof the month. Monthly accounts used to be recorded\non some wall in pencil. Baking was indeed a\nprofitable profession in the old days. The baker and\nhis family never starved. He, his family and his\nservants always looked happy and prosperous. Their\nplump physique was an open testimony to this.

Almost\neveryone in their compartment was drinking tea too.\n“Do you know that over eighty crore cups of tea\nare drunk every day throughout the world?” Rajvir said.\n“Whew!” exclaimed Pranjol. “Tea really is very\npopular.”\nThe train pulled out of the station. Pranjol buried\nhis nose in his detective book again. Rajvir too was\nan ardent fan of detective stories, but at the moment\nhe was keener on looking at the beautiful scenery.\nIt was green, green everywhere. Rajvir had never\nseen so much greenery before. Then the soft green\npaddy fields gave way to tea bushes.\nIt was a magnificent view. Against the backdrop\nof densely wooded hills a sea of tea bushes stretched\nas far as the eye could see. Dwarfing the tiny tea\nplants were tall sturdy shade-trees and amidst the\norderly rows of bushes busily moved doll-like figures.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nGlimpses of India\n73\nIn the distance was an ugly building with smoke\nbillowing out of tall chimneys.\n“Hey, a tea garden!” Rajvir cried excitedly.\nPranjol, who had been born and brought up on\na plantation, didn’t share Rajvir’s excitement.\n“Oh, this is tea country now,” he said. “Assam has\nthe largest concentration of plantations in the world.\nYou will see enough gardens to last you a lifetime!”\n“I have been reading as much as I could about\ntea,” Rajvir said. “No one really knows who\ndiscovered tea but there are many legends.”\n“What legends?”\n“Well, there’s the one about the Chinese emperor\nwho always boiled water before drinking it. One\nday a few leaves of the twigs burning under the pot\nfell into the water giving it a delicious flavour. It is\nsaid they were tea leaves.”\n“Tell me another!” scoffed Pranjol.\n“We have an Indian legend too. Bodhidharma, an\nancient Buddhist ascetic, cut off his eyelids because\nhe felt sleepy during meditations. Ten tea plants\ngrew out of the eyelids. The leaves of these plants\nwhen put in hot water and drunk banished sleep.\n“Tea was first drunk in China,” Rajvir added,\n“as far back as 2700 B.C.! In fact words such as\ntea, ‘chai’ and ‘chini’ are from Chinese. Tea came to\nEurope only in the sixteenth century and was drunk\nmore as medicine than as beverage.”\nThe train clattered into Mariani junction. The\nboys collected their luggage and pushed their way\nto the crowded platform.\nPranjol’s parents were waiting for them.\nSoon they were driving towards Dhekiabari, the\ntea-garden managed by Pranjol’s father.\nAn hour later the car veered sharply off the main\nroad. They crossed a cattle-bridge and entered\nDhekiabari Tea Estate.\nOn both sides of the gravel-road were acre upon\nacre of tea bushes, all neatly pruned to the same\nheight.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \nParagraph (1) \n(ii) \nWhich of the following statements best describes the comparison \nmade in the sentence ? \n1 \n \n‘‘Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices.’’  \n(A) \nGold and saffron have similar physical properties. \n(B) \nGold and saffron have equal monetary value. \n(C) \nSaffron is considered the most valuable spice, similar to how \ngold is valued among metals.  \n(D) \nGold and saffron are both rare commodities in the global \nmarket.

    "book_content": "The Tale of Custard\nthe Dragon\nThis poem is written in the style of a ballad — a song\nor poem that tells a story. You must be familiar with ballads that\nnarrate tales of courage or heroism. This poem is a humorous\nballad close to a parody.\nRead it aloud, paying attention to the rhythm.\nBelinda lived in a little white house,\nWith a little black kitten and a little grey mouse,\nAnd a little yellow dog and a little red wagon,\nAnd a realio, trulio, little pet dragon.\nNow the name of the little black kitten was Ink,\nAnd the little grey mouse, she called him Blink,\nAnd the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard,\nBut the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard.\nCustard the dragon had big sharp teeth,\nAnd spikes on top of him and scales underneath,\nMouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose,\nAnd realio, trulio daggers on his toes.\nBelinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears,\nAnd Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs,\nMustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage,\nBut Custard cried for a nice safe cage.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBelinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful,\nInk, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival,\nThey all sat laughing in the little red wagon\nAt the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon.\nBelinda giggled till she shook the house,\nAnd Blink said Weeck! which is giggling for a mouse,\nInk and Mustard rudely asked his age,\nWhen Custard cried for a nice safe cage.\nSuddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound,\nAnd Mustard growled, and they all looked around.\nMeowch! cried Ink, and ooh! cried Belinda,\nFor there was a pirate, climbing in the winda.\nPistol in his left hand, pistol in his right,\nAnd he held in his teeth a cutlass bright,\nHis beard was black, one leg was wood;\nIt was clear that the pirate meant no good.\nBelinda paled, and she cried Help! Help!\nBut Mustard fled with a terrified yelp,\nInk trickled down to the bottom of the household,\nAnd little mouse Blink strategically mouseholed.\nBut up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine,\nClashed his tail like irons in a dungeon,\nWith a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm,\nHe went at the pirate like a robin at a worm.\nThe pirate gaped at Belinda’s dragon,\nAnd gulped some grog from his pocket flagon,\nHe fired two bullets, but they didn’t hit,\nAnd Custard gobbled him, every bit.\nFirst Flight\n108\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBelinda embraced him, Mustard licked him,\nNo one mourned for his pirate victim.\nInk and Blink in glee did gyrate\nAround the dragon that ate the pirate.\nBut presently up spoke little dog Mustard,\nI’d have been twice as brave if I hadn’t been flustered.\nAnd up spoke Ink and up spoke Blink,\nWe’d have been three times as brave, we think,\nAnd Custard said, I quite agree\nThat everybody is braver than me.\nBelinda still lives in her little white house,\nWith her little black kitten and her little grey mouse,\nAnd her little yellow dog and her little red wagon,\nAnd her realio, trulio little pet dragon.\nBelinda is as brave as a barrel full of bears,\nAnd Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs,\nMustard is as brave as a tiger in a rage,\nBut Custard keeps crying for a nice safe cage.\nOGDEN NASH\nOgden Nash wrote over four hundred pieces of comic verse. The\nbest of his work was published in 14 volumes between 1931 and\n1972. His work is perhaps best described in this poetic tribute by\nAnthony Burgess:\n...he brought a new kind of sound to our literary diversions.\nAnd didn’t care much about breaking the poetic laws of the Medes\nand the Persians.\nHe uses lines, sometimes of considerable length that are colloquial\nand prosy.\nAnd at the end presents you with a rhyme...\nThis bringing together of the informal and the formal is what his\ngenius chiefly loves.\nI am trying to imitate him here, but he is probably quite inimitable.\nThe Tale of Custard the Dragon\n109\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFirst Flight\n110\ngrog: a drink typically drunk by sailors\ngyrate: to move around in circles\n1.\nWho are the characters in this poem? List them with their pet names.\n2.\nWhy did Custard cry for a nice safe cage?  Why is the dragon called “cowardly\ndragon”?\n3.\n“Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful...” Why?\n4.\nThe poet has employed many poetic devices in the poem. For example:\n“Clashed his tail like iron in a dungeon” — the poetic device here is a\nsimile. Can you, with your partner, list some more such poetic devices\nused in the poem?\n5.\nRead stanza three again to know how the poet describes the appearance of\nthe  dragon.\n6.\nCan you find out the rhyme scheme of two or three stanzas of the poem?\n7.\nWriters use words to give us a picture or image without actually saying what\nthey mean. Can you trace some images used in the poem?\n8.\nDo you find The Tale of Custard the Dragon to be a serious or a light-hearted\npoem? Give reasons to support your answer.\n9.\nThis poem, in ballad form, tells a story.  Have you come across any such\nmodern song or lyric that tells a story? If you know one, tell it to the class.\nCollect such songs as a project.\nHave fun writing your ballad. Gather information (choose/decide an idea/theme),\norganise your materials under characters and story and then write. Revise and edit\nyour ballad to make it entertaining. Use the following guidelines to write your ballad.\n•\nPurpose of writing the ballad: to entertain and interest\n•\nTo whom I am writing: decide for whom you are writing\n•\nHow should I structure features?:\n– Tell a simple narrative\n– A few major characters\n– A strong rhythm and rhyme\n– May have a refrain (single or two line(s) repeated often)\n– Divide into verses\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBEFORE YOU READ\nActivity\nUse a dictionary or ask for your teacher’s help as you discuss\nthe following questions in groups.\n1.\nWhat is a sermon?

Who delivered\nit?  Who do you think delivered a sermon at Benares?\nGAUTAMA Buddha (563 B.C. – 483 B.C.) began life as a\nprince named Siddhartha Gautama, in northern\nIndia. At twelve, he was sent away for schooling in\nthe Hindu sacred scriptures and four years later he\nreturned home to marry a princess. They had a son\nand lived for ten years as befitted royalty. At about\nthe age of twenty-five, the Prince, heretofore shielded\nfrom the sufferings of the world, while out hunting\nchanced upon a sick man, then an aged man, then\na funeral procession, and finally a monk begging\nfor alms. These sights so moved him that he at\nonce went out into the world to seek enlightenment\nconcerning the sorrows he had witnessed.\nHe wandered for seven years and finally sat\ndown under a peepal tree, where he vowed to stay\nchanced upon\ncame across by\nchance\nenlightenment\na state of high\nspiritual knowledge\nReprint 2025-26\n\n112\nFirst Flight\nuntil enlightenment came. Enlightened after seven\ndays, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of\nWisdom) and began to teach and to share his new\nunderstandings. At that point he became known as\nthe Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The\nBuddha preached his first sermon at the city of\nBenares, most holy of the dipping places on the River\nGanges; that sermon has been preserved and is given\nhere. It reflects the Buddha’s wisdom about one\ninscrutable kind of suffering.\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief\nshe carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking\nthem for medicine, and the people said, “She has lost\nher senses. The boy is dead.”\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her\nrequest, “I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I\nknow a physician who can.”\nAnd the girl said, “Pray tell me, sir; who is it?” And\nthe man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.”\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, “Lord\nand Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.”\nThe Buddha answered, “I want a handful of mustard-\nseed.” And  when the girl in her joy  promised to procure\nit, the Buddha added, “The mustard-seed must be taken\nfrom a  house where no one has lost a child, husband,\nparent or friend.”\nPoor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house,\nand the people pitied her and said, “Here is mustard-\nseed; take it!” But when she asked, “Did a son or\ndaughter, a father or mother, die in your family?” they\nanswered her, “Alas! the living are few, but the dead are\nmany. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.” And there\nwas no house but some beloved one had died in it.\nKisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat\ndown at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as\nthey flickered up and were extinguished again. At last\nthe darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she\nconsidered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up\nand are extinguished again. And she thought to herself,\n“How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all;\nyet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads\nhim to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.”\nThe Buddha said, ‘‘The life of mortals in this world\nis troubled and brief and combined with pain. For there\nsermon\nreligious or moral\ntalk\ndipping places\nbathing\ninscrutable\nsomething which\ncannot be\nunderstood\nrepaired (a stylistic\nuse) went to\nvalley of\ndesolation\nan area which is filled\nwith deep sorrow\nmortals\nthose bound to die\nReprint 2025-26\n\n113\nThe Sermon at Benares\nis not any means by which those that have been born\ncan avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death; of\nsuch a nature are living beings. As ripe fruits are early\nin danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in\ndanger of death. As all earthen vessels made by the\npotter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. Both\nyoung and adult, both those who are fools and those\nwho are wise, all fall into the power of death; all are\nsubject to death.\n“Of those who, overcome by death, depart from life,\na father cannot save his son, nor kinsmen their relations.\nMark! while relatives are looking on and lamenting\ndeeply, one by one mortals are carried off, like an ox\nthat is led to the slaughter. So the world is afflicted  with\ndeath and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve,\nknowing the terms of the world.\n“Not from weeping nor from grieving will anyone\nobtain peace of mind; on the contrary, his pain will be\nthe greater and his body will suffer. He will make himself\nsick and pale, yet the dead are not saved by his\nlamentation. He who seeks peace should draw out the\narrow of lamentation, and complaint, and grief. He who\nhas drawn out the arrow and has become composed\nwill obtain peace of mind; he who has overcome all\nsorrow will become free from sorrow, and be blessed.”\n[Source: Betty Renshaw\nValues and Voices: A College Reader (1975)]\nafflicted with\naffected by suffering,\ndisease or pain\nlamentation\nexpression of sorrow\n1.\nWhen her son dies, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house. What does she\nask for? Does she get it? Why not?\n2.\nKisa Gotami again goes from house to house after she speaks with the\nBuddha. What does she ask for, the second time around? Does she get it?\nWhy not?\n3.\nWhat does Kisa Gotami understand the second time that she failed to\nunderstand the first time? Was this what the Buddha wanted her to\nunderstand?\n4.\nWhy do you think Kisa Gotami understood this only the second time? In\nwhat way did the Buddha change her understanding?\n5.\nHow do you usually understand the idea of ‘selfishness’? Do you agree with\nKisa Gotami that she was being ‘selfish in her grief ’?\nReprint 2025-26\n\n114\nFirst Flight\nI. This text is written in an old-fashioned style, for it reports an incident\nmore than two millennia old. Look for the following words and phrases\nin the text, and try to rephrase them in more current language, based\non how you understand them.\n•\ngive thee medicine for thy child\n•\nPray tell me\n•\nKisa repaired to the Buddha\n•\nthere was no house but someone had died in it\n•\nkinsmen\n•\nMark!\nII. You know that we can combine sentences using words like and, or, but, yet\nand then. But sometimes no such word seems appropriate. In such a case\nwe can use a semicolon (;) or a dash (—) to combine two clauses.\nShe has no interest in music; I doubt she will become a singer like\nher mother.\nThe second clause here gives the speaker’s opinion on the first clause.\nHere is a sentence from the text that uses semicolons to combine\nclauses. Break up the sentence into three simple sentences. Can you\nthen say which has a better rhythm when you read it, the single sentence\nusing semicolons, or the three simple sentences?\nFor there is not any means by which those who have been born can avoid\ndying; after reaching old age there is death; of such a nature are living beings.\nThe Buddha’s sermon is over 2500 years old. Given below are two recent texts\non the topic of grief. Read the texts, comparing them with each other and with\nthe Buddha’s sermon. Do you think the Buddha’s ideas and way of teaching\ncontinue to hold meaning for us? Or have we found better ways to deal with\ngrief? Discuss this in groups or in class.\nI. A Guide to Coping with the Death\nof a Loved One\nMartha is having difficulty sleeping lately and no longer enjoys doing things\nwith her friends. Martha lost her husband of 26 years to cancer a month ago.\nAnya, age 17, doesn’t feel like eating and spends the days in her room\ncrying. Her grandmother recently died.\nBoth of these individuals are experiencing grief. Grief is an emotion\nnatural to all types of loss or significant change.\nReprint 2025-26\n\n115\nThe Sermon at Benares\nFeelings of Grief\nAlthough grief is unique and personal, a broad range of feelings and\nbehaviours are commonly experienced after the death of a loved one.\n•\nSadness. This is the most common, and it is not necessarily manifested\nby crying.\n•\nAnger. This is one of the most confusing feelings for a survivor. There\nmay be frustration at not being able to prevent the death, and a sense\nof not being able to exist without the loved one.\n•\nGuilt and Self-reproach. People may believe that they were not kind\nenough or caring enough to the person who died, or that the person\nshould have seen the doctor sooner.\n•\nAnxiety. An individual may fear that she/he won’t be able to care for\nherself/himself.\n•\nLoneliness. There are reminders throughout the day that a partner,\nfamily member or friend is gone. For example, meals are no longer\nprepared the same way, phone calls to share a special moment don’t\nhappen.\n•\nFatigue. There is an overall sense of feeling tired.\n•\nDisbelief: This occurs particularly if it was a sudden death.\nHelping Others Who Are Experiencing Grief\nWhen a friend, loved one, or co-worker is experiencing grief—how can we\nhelp? It helps to understand that grief is expressed through a variety of\nbehaviours.\nReach out to others in their grief, but understand that some may not\nwant to accept help and will not share their grief.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \nParagraph (1) \n(ii) \nWhich of the following statements best describes the comparison \nmade in the sentence ? \n1 \n \n‘‘Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices.’’  \n(A) \nGold and saffron have similar physical properties. \n(B) \nGold and saffron have equal monetary value. \n(C) \nSaffron is considered the most valuable spice, similar to how \ngold is valued among metals.  \n(D) \nGold and saffron are both rare commodities in the global \nmarket.

Is she wise in this?\n• Who does ‘I’ refer to in this story?\nI WAS really worried about Tricki this time. I had pulled up my car\nwhen I saw him in the street with his mistress and I was shocked at\nhis appearance. He had become hugely fat, like a bloated sausage with\na leg at each corner. His eyes, bloodshot and rheumy, stared straight\nahead and his tongue lolled from his jaws.\nMrs Pumphrey hastened to explain, “He was so listless, Mr Herriot.\nHe seemed to have no energy. I thought he must be suffering from\nmalnutrition, so I have been giving him some little extras between\nmeals to build him up, some malt and cod-liver oil and a bowl of\nHorlicks at night to make him sleep — nothing much really.”\n“And did you cut down on the sweet things as I told you?”\n“Oh, I did for a bit, but he seemed to be so weak I had to relent. He\ndoes love cream cakes and chocolates so. I can’t bear to refuse him.”\nI looked down again at the little dog. That was the trouble. Tricki’s\nonly fault was greed. He had never been known to refuse food; he\nwould tackle a meal at any hour of the day or night. And I wondered\nabout all the things Mrs Pumphrey hadn’t mentioned.\n“Are you giving him plenty of exercise?”\n“Well, he has his little walks with me as you can see, but Hodgkin,\nthe gardener, has been down with lumbago, so there has been no\nring-throwing lately.”\nTricki, a small dog, is pampered and overfed\nby his rich mistress. He falls seriously ill and\nhis mistress consults a veterinary surgeon. Does\nhe perform an operation? Does the dog recover?\nA Triumph of Surgery\n1\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n2\nI tried to sound severe: “Now I really mean this. If you don’t cut his\nfood right down and give him more exercise he is going to be really ill.\nYou must harden your heart and keep him on a very strict diet.”\nMrs Pumphrey wrung her hands. “Oh I will, Mr Herriot. I’m sure\nyou are right, but it is so difficult, so very difficult.” She set off, head\ndown, along the road, as if determined to put the new regime into\npractice immediately.\nI watched their progress with growing concern. Tricki was tottering\nalong in his little tweed coat; he had a whole wardrobe of these coats —\nfor the cold weather and a raincoat for the wet days. He struggled on,\ndrooping in his harness. I thought it wouldn’t be long before I heard\nfrom Mrs Pumphrey.\nThe expected call came within a few days. Mrs Pumphrey was\ndistraught. Tricki would eat nothing. Refused even his favourite dishes;\nand besides, he had bouts of vomiting. He spent all his time lying on a\nrug, panting. Didn’t want to go for walks, didn’t want to do anything.\nI had made my plans in advance. The only way was to get Tricki out\nof the house for a period. I suggested that he be hospitalised for about\na fortnight to be kept under observation.\nThe poor lady almost swooned. She was sure he would pine and die\nif he did not see her every day.\nBut I took a firm line. Tricki was very ill and this was the only way\nto save him; in fact, I thought it best to take him without delay and,\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Triumph of Surgery 3\nfollowed by Mrs Pumphrey’s wailings, I marched out to the car carrying\nthe little dog wrapped in a blanket.\nThe entire staff was roused and maids rushed in and out bringing\nhis day bed, his night bed, favourite cushions, toys and rubber rings,\nbreakfast bowl, lunch bowl, supper bowl. Realising that my car would\nnever hold all the stuff, I started to drive away. As I moved off, Mrs\nPumphrey, with a despairing cry, threw an armful of the little coats\nthrough the window. I looked in the mirror before I turned the corner\nof the drive; everybody was in tears.\nOut on the road, I glanced down at the pathetic little animal gasping\non the seat by my side. I patted the head and Tricki made a brave\neffort to wag his tail. “Poor old lad,” I said. “You haven’t a kick in you\nbut I think I know a cure for you.”\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• Is the narrator as rich as Tricki’s mistress?\n• How does he treat the dog?\n• Why is he tempted to keep Tricki on as a permanent guest?\n• Why does Mrs Pumphrey think the dog’s recovery is “a\ntriumph of  surgery”?\nAt the surgery, the household dogs surged round me. Tricki looked\ndown at the noisy pack with dull eyes and, when put down, lay motionless\non the carpet. The other dogs, after sniffing round him for a few seconds,\ndecided he was an uninteresting object and ignored him.\nI made up a bed for him in a warm loose box next to the one where\nthe other dogs slept. For two days I kept an eye on him, giving him no\nfood but plenty of water. At the end of the second day he started to\nshow some interest in his surroundings and on the third he began to\nwhimper when he heard the dogs in the yard.\nWhen I opened the door, Tricki trotted out and was immediately\nengulfed by Joe, the greyhound, and his friends. After rolling him over\nand thoroughly inspecting him, the dogs moved off down the garden.\nTricki followed them, rolling slightly with his surplus fat.\nLater that day, I was present at feeding time. I watched while Tristan\nslopped the food into the bowls. There was the usual headlong rush\nfollowed by the sounds of high-speed eating; every dog knew that if he\nfell behind the others he was liable to have some competition for the\nlast part of his meal.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n4\nWhen they had finished, Tricki took a walk round the shining bowls,\nlicking casually inside one or two of them. Next day, an extra bowl was\nput out for him and I was pleased to see him jostling his way towards it.\nFrom then on, his progress was rapid. He had no medicinal treatment\nof any kind but all day he ran about with the dogs, joining in their\nfriendly scrimmages. He discovered the joys of being bowled over, tramped\non and squashed every few minutes. He became an accepted member of\nthe gang, an unlikely, silky little object among the shaggy crew, fighting\nlike a tiger for his share at mealtimes and hunting rats in the old hen-\nhouse at night. He had never had such a time in his life.\nAll the while, Mrs Pumphrey hovered anxiously in the background,\nringing a dozen times a day for the latest bulletins. I dodged the\nquestions about whether his cushions were being turned regularly or\nhis correct coat worn according to the weather; but I was able to tell\nher that the little fellow was out of danger and convalescing rapidly.\nThe word ‘convalescing’ seemed to do something to Mrs Pumphrey.\nShe started to bring round fresh eggs, two dozen at a time, to build up\nTricki’s strength. For a happy period my partners and I had two eggs\neach for breakfast, but when the bottles of wine began to arrive, the\nreal possibilities of the situation began to dawn on the household.\nIt was to enrich Tricki’s blood. Lunch became a ceremonial occasion\nwith two glasses of wine before and several during the meal.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Triumph of Surgery 5\nWe could hardly believe it when the brandy came to put a final edge\non Tricki’s constitution. For a few nights the fine spirit was rolled\naround, inhaled and reverently drunk.\nThey were days of deep content, starting well with the extra egg in\nthe morning, improved and sustained by the midday wine and finishing\nluxuriously round the fire with the brandy.\nIt was a temptation to keep Tricki on as a permanent guest, but\nI knew Mrs Pumphrey was suffering and after a fortnight, felt\ncompelled to phone and tell her that the little dog had recovered\nand was awaiting collection.\nWithin minutes, about thirty feet of gleaming black metal drew up\noutside the surgery. The chauffeur opened the door and I could just\nmake out the figure of Mrs Pumphrey almost lost in the interior. Her\nhands were tightly clasped in front of her; her lips trembled. “Oh, Mr\nHerriot, do tell me the truth. Is he really better?”\n“Yes, he’s fine. There’s no need for you to get out of the car — I’ll go\nand  fetch him.”\nI walked through the house into the garden. A mass of dogs was\nhurtling round and round the lawn and in their midst, ears flapping,\ntail waving, was the little golden figure of Tricki. In two weeks he had\nbeen transformed into a lithe, hard-muscled animal; he was keeping\nup well with the pack, stretching out in great bounds, his chest almost\nbrushing the ground.\nI carried him back along the passage to the front of the house. The\nchauffeur was still holding the car door open and when Tricki saw his\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n6\nGLOSSARY\nsausage: finely minced meat stuffed into long cylindrical cases and\ndivided into small lengths by twisting or tying\nrheumy: a watery discharge from a mucous membrane especially of\nthe nose or eyes\nlistless: lacking energy and enthusiasm\nlumbago: muscular pain in the lower part of the back (lumbar region)\nregime: prescribed course of exercise and diet\ndistraught: extremely worried\nsurgery: a place where a doctor, a dentist or a veterinary surgeon treats\npatients\nscrimmage: rough or confused struggle\nconvalescing: recovering from an illness\nlithe: flexible\n1.\nWhat kind of a person do you think the narrator, a veterinary\nsurgeon, is?

She gave a startled “Ooh!” And then had to\ndefend herself as he swarmed over her, licking her face and barking.\nDuring the excitement, I helped the chauffeur to bring out the beds,\ntoys, cushions, coats and bowls, none of which had been used. As the\ncar moved away, Mrs Pumphrey leaned out of the window. Tears shone\nin her eyes. Her lips trembled.\n“Oh, Mr Herriot,” she cried, “how can I ever thank you? This is a\ntriumph of surgery!”\nJAMES HERRIOT\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Triumph of Surgery 7\nSuggested reading\nTalk about it\n1.\nThis episode describes the silly behaviour of a rich woman who is\nfoolishly indulgent, perhaps because she is lonely.

And though only 15, I was an\nexperienced and fairly successful hand.\nAnil was watching a wrestling match when I approached him. He\nwas about 25 — a tall, lean fellow — and he looked easy-going, kind\nand simple enough for my purpose. I hadn’t had much luck of late and\nthought I might be able to get into the young man’s confidence.\n“You look a bit of a wrestler yourself,” I said. A little flattery helps\nin making friends.\n“So do you,” he replied, which put me off for a moment because at\nthat time I was rather thin.\n“Well,” I said modestly, “I do wrestle a bit.”\n“What’s your name?”\n“Hari Singh,” I lied. I took a new name every month. That kept me\nahead of the police and my former employers.\nAfter this introduction, Anil talked about the well-oiled wrestlers\nwho were grunting, lifting and throwing each other about. I didn’t\nhave much to say. Anil walked away. I followed casually.\n“Hello again,” he said.\nI gave him my most appealing smile. “I want to work for you,” I said.\n“But I can’t pay you.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nI thought that over for a minute. Perhaps I had misjudged my man.\nI asked, “Can you feed me?”\n“Can you cook?”\n“I can cook,” I lied again.\n“If you can cook, then may be I can feed you.”\nHe took me to his room over the Jumna Sweet Shop and told me I\ncould sleep on the balcony. But the meal I cooked that night must\nhave been terrible because Anil gave it to a stray dog and told me to be\noff. But I just hung around, smiling in my most appealing way, and he\ncouldn’t help laughing.\nLater, he patted me on the head and said never mind, he’d teach\nme to cook. He also taught me to write my name and said he would\nsoon teach me to write whole sentences and to add numbers. I was\ngrateful. I knew that once I could write like an educated man there\nwould be no limit to what I could achieve.\nIt was quite pleasant working for Anil. I...[truncated]",

    "book_content": "A young boy makes friends with Anil.\nAnil trusts him completely and employs\nhim. Does the boy betray his trust?\nThe Thief's Story\n2\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• Who does ‘I’ refer to in this story?\n• What is he “a fairly successful hand” at?\n• What does he get from Anil in return for his work?\nI WAS still a thief when I met Anil. And though only 15, I was an\nexperienced and fairly successful hand.\nAnil was watching a wrestling match when I approached him. He\nwas about 25 — a tall, lean fellow — and he looked easy-going, kind\nand simple enough for my purpose. I hadn’t had much luck of late and\nthought I might be able to get into the young man’s confidence.\n“You look a bit of a wrestler yourself,” I said. A little flattery helps\nin making friends.\n“So do you,” he replied, which put me off for a moment because at\nthat time I was rather thin.\n“Well,” I said modestly, “I do wrestle a bit.”\n“What’s your name?”\n“Hari Singh,” I lied. I took a new name every month. That kept me\nahead of the police and my former employers.\nAfter this introduction, Anil talked about the well-oiled wrestlers\nwho were grunting, lifting and throwing each other about. I didn’t\nhave much to say. Anil walked away. I followed casually.\n“Hello again,” he said.\nI gave him my most appealing smile. “I want to work for you,” I said.\n“But I can’t pay you.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nI thought that over for a minute. Perhaps I had misjudged my man.\nI asked, “Can you feed me?”\n“Can you cook?”\n“I can cook,” I lied again.\n“If you can cook, then may be I can feed you.”\nHe took me to his room over the Jumna Sweet Shop and told me I\ncould sleep on the balcony. But the meal I cooked that night must\nhave been terrible because Anil gave it to a stray dog and told me to be\noff. But I just hung around, smiling in my most appealing way, and he\ncouldn’t help laughing.\nLater, he patted me on the head and said never mind, he’d teach\nme to cook. He also taught me to write my name and said he would\nsoon teach me to write whole sentences and to add numbers. I was\ngrateful. I knew that once I could write like an educated man there\nwould be no limit to what I could achieve.\nIt was quite pleasant working for Anil. I made the tea in the morning\nand then would take my time buying the day’s supplies, usually making\na profit of about a rupee a day. I think he knew I made a little money\nthis way but he did not seem to mind.\nThe Thief’s Story\n9\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n10\nAnil made money by fits and starts. He would borrow one week, lend\nthe next. He kept worrying about his next cheque, but as soon as it\narrived he would go out and celebrate. It seems he wrote for magazines —\na queer way to make a living!\nOne evening he came home with a small bundle of notes, saying he\nhad just sold a book to a publisher. At night, I saw him tuck the money\nunder the mattress.\nI had been working for Anil for almost a month and, apart from\ncheating on the shopping, had not done anything in my line of work. I\nhad every opportunity for doing so. Anil had given me a key to the door,\nand I could come and go as I pleased. He was the most trusting person\nI had ever met.\nAnd that is why it was so difficult to rob him. It’s easy to rob a\ngreedy man, because he can afford to be robbed; but it’s difficult to rob\na careless man — sometimes he doesn’t even notice he’s been robbed\nand that takes all the pleasure out of the work.\nWell, it’s time I did some real work, I told myself; I’m out of practice.\nAnd if I don’t take the money, he’ll only waste it on his friends. After\nall, he doesn’t even pay me.\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• How does the thief think Anil will react to the theft?\n• What does he say about the different reactions of people\nwhen they are  robbed?\n• Does Anil realise that he has been robbed?\nAnil was asleep. A beam of moonlight stepped over the balcony and\nfell on the bed. I sat up on the floor, considering the situation. If I took\nthe money, I could catch the 10.30 Express to Lucknow. Slipping out of\nthe blanket, I crept up to the bed. Anil was sleeping peacefully. His\nface was clear and unlined; even I had more marks on my face, though\nmine were mostly scars.\nMy hand slid under the mattress, searching for the notes. When I\nfound them, I drew them out without a sound. Anil sighed in his sleep\nand turned on his side, towards me. I was startled and quickly crawled\nout of the room.\nWhen I was on the road, I began to run. I had the notes at my waist,\nheld there by the string of my pyjamas. I slowed down to a walk and\ncounted the notes: 600 rupees in fifties! I could live like an oil-rich\nArab for a week or two.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Thief’s Story 11\nWhen I reached the station I did not stop at the ticket office (I had\nnever bought a ticket in my life) but dashed straight to the platform.\nThe Lucknow Express was just moving out. The train had still to pick\nup speed and I should have been able to jump into one of the carriages,\nbut I hesitated — for some reason I can’t explain — and I lost the\nchance to get away.\nWhen the train had gone, I found myself standing alone on the\ndeserted platform. I had no idea where to spend the night. I had no\nfriends, believing that friends were more trouble than help. And I did\nnot want to make anyone curious by staying at one of the small hotels\nnear the station. The only person I knew really well was the man I had\nrobbed. Leaving the station, I walked slowly through the bazaar.\nIn my short career as a thief, I had made a study of men’s faces\nwhen they had lost their goods. The greedy man showed fear; the rich\nman showed anger; the poor man showed acceptance. But I knew that\nAnil’s face, when he discovered the theft, would show only a touch of\nsadness. Not for the loss of money, but for the loss of trust.\nI found myself in the maidan and sat down on a bench. The night\nwas chilly — it was early November — and a light drizzle added to my\ndiscomfort. Soon it was raining quite heavily. My shirt and pyjamas\nstuck to my skin, and a cold wind blew the rain across my face.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n12\nI went back to the bazaar and sat down in the shelter of the clock\ntower. The clock showed midnight. I felt for the notes. They were damp\nfrom the rain.\nAnil’s money. In the morning he would probably have given me two or\nthree rupees to go to the cinema, but now I had it all. I couldn’t cook his\nmeals, run to the bazaar or learn to write whole sentences any more.\nI had forgotten about them in the excitement of the theft. Whole\nsentences, I knew, could one day bring me more than a few hundred\nrupees. It was a simple matter to steal — and sometimes just as simple\nto be caught. But to be a really big man, a clever and respected man,\nwas something else. I  should go back to Anil, I told myself, if only to\nlearn to read and write.\nI hurried back to the room feeling very nervous, for it is much\neasier to steal something than to return it undetected. I opened the\ndoor quietly, then stood in the doorway, in clouded moonlight. Anil\nwas still asleep. I crept to the head of the bed, and my hand came up\nwith the notes. I felt his breath on my hand. I remained still for a\nminute. Then my hand found the edge of the mattress, and slipped\nunder it with the notes.\nI awoke late next morning to find that Anil had already made the\ntea. He stretched out his hand towards me. There was a fifty-rupee\nnote between his fingers. My heart sank. I thought I had been discovered.\n“I made some money yesterday,” he explained. “Now you’ll be paid\nregularly.”\nMy spirits rose. But when I took the note, I saw it was still wet from\nthe night’s rain.\n“Today we’ll start writing sentences,” he said.\nHe knew. But neither his lips nor his eyes showed anything. I smiled\nat Anil in my most appealing way. And the smile came by itself, without\nany effort.\nRUSKIN BOND\nGLOSSARY\nflattery: insincere praise\nmodestly: without boasting; in a humble way\ngrunting: making low guttural sounds\nappealing: attractive\nunlined: (here) showing no sign of worry or anxiety\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Thief’s Story 13\n1.\nWhat are Hari Singh’s reactions to the prospect of receiving an\neducation?

Following him down the musty corridor of the gloomy French\nhotel where Ausable had a room, Fowler felt let down. It was a\nsmall room, on the sixth and top floor, and scarcely a setting for a\nromantic adventure.\nAusable was, for one thing, fat. Very fat. And then there was his\naccent. Though he spoke French and German passably, he had never\naltogether lost the American accent he had brought to Paris from Boston\ntwenty years ago.\n“You are disappointed,” Ausable said wheezily over his shoulder.\n“You were told that I was a secret agent, a spy, dealing in espionage\nand danger. You wished to meet me because you are a writer, young\nand romantic. You envisioned mysterious figures in the night, the crack\nof pistols, drugs in the wine.”\n“Instead, you have spent a dull evening in a French music hall\nwith a sloppy fat man who, instead of having messages slipped into\nhis hand by dark-eyed beauties, gets only a prosaic telephone call\nmaking an appointment in his room. You have been bored!” The fat\nman chuckled to himself as he unlocked the door of his room and\nstood aside to let his frustrated guest enter.\n“You are disillusioned,” Ausable told him. “But take cheer, my young\nfriend.

Then he switched\non the light.\nAnd as the light came on, Fowler had his first authentic thrill of\nthe day. For halfway across the room, a small automatic pistol in his\nhand, stood a man.\nAusable blinked a few times.\n“Max,” he wheezed, “you gave me quite a start. I thought you were\nin Berlin. What are you doing here in my room?”\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• How has Max got in?\n• How does Ausable say he got in?\nMax was slender, a little less than tall, with  features  that suggested\nslightly the crafty, pointed countenance of a fox. There was about him —\naside from the gun — nothing especially menacing.\n“The report,” he murmured. “The report that is being brought to\nyou tonight concerning some new missiles. I thought I would take it\nfrom you. It will be safer in my hands than in yours.”\nThe Midnight Visitor 15\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n16\nAusable moved to an armchair and sat down heavily. “I’m going to\nraise the devil with the management this time, and you can bet on it,”\nhe said grimly. “This is the second time in a month that somebody has\ngot into my room through that nuisance of a balcony!” Fowler’s eyes\nwent to the single window of the room. It was an ordinary window,\nagainst which now the night was pressing blackly.\n “Balcony?” Max said, with a rising inflection. “No, a passkey. I did\nnot know about the balcony. It might have saved me some trouble\nhad I known.”\n“It’s not my balcony,” Ausable said with extreme irritation. “It belongs\nto the next apartment.” He glanced explanatorily at Fowler. “You see,”\nhe said, “this room used to be part of a large unit, and the next room —\nthrough that door there — used to be the living room. It had the balcony,\nwhich extends under my window now. You can get onto it from the\nempty room two doors down — and somebody did, last month. The\nmanagement promised to block it off. But they haven’t.”\nMax glanced at Fowler, who was standing stiffly not far  from Ausable,\nand waved the gun with a commanding gesture. “Please sit down,” he\nsaid. “We have a wait of half an hour, I think.”\n“Thirty-one minutes,” Ausable said moodily. “The appointment was\nfor twelve-thirty. I wish I knew how you learned about the report, Max.”\nThe little spy smiled evilly. “And we wish we knew how your people\ngot the report. But no harm has been done. I will get it back tonight.\nWhat is that? Who is at the door?”\nFowler jumped at the sudden knocking at the door. Ausable just\nsmiled. “That will be the police,” he said. “I thought that such an\nimportant paper as the one we are waiting for should have a little\nextra protection. I told them to check on me to make sure everything\nwas all right.”\nMax bit his lip nervously. The knocking was repeated.\n“What will you do now, Max?” Ausable asked. “If I do not answer the\ndoor, they will enter anyway. The door is unlocked. And they will not\nhesitate to shoot.”\nMax’s face was black with anger as he backed swiftly towards the\nwindow. He swung a leg over the sill. “Send them away!” he warned. “I\nwill wait on the balcony.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin.

Is she wise in this?\n• Who does ‘I’ refer to in this story?\nI WAS really worried about Tricki this time. I had pulled up my car\nwhen I saw him in the street with his mistress and I was shocked at\nhis appearance. He had become hugely fat, like a bloated sausage with\na leg at each corner. His eyes, bloodshot and rheumy, stared straight\nahead and his tongue lolled from his jaws.\nMrs Pumphrey hastened to explain, “He was so listless, Mr Herriot.\nHe seemed to have no energy. I thought he must be suffering from\nmalnutrition, so I have been giving him some little extras between\nmeals to build him up, some malt and cod-liver oil and a bowl of\nHorlicks at night to make him sleep — nothing much really.”\n“And did you cut down on the sweet things as I told you?”\n“Oh, I did for a bit, but he seemed to be so weak I had to relent. He\ndoes love cream cakes and chocolates so. I can’t bear to refuse him.”\nI looked down again at the little dog. That was the trouble. Tricki’s\nonly fault was greed. He had never been known to refuse food; he\nwould tackle a meal at any hour of the day or night. And I wondered\nabout all the things Mrs Pumphrey hadn’t mentioned.\n“Are you giving him plenty of exercise?”\n“Well, he has his little walks with me as you can see, but Hodgkin,\nthe gardener, has been down with lumbago, so there has been no\nring-throwing lately.”\nTricki, a small dog, is pampered and overfed\nby his rich mistress. He falls seriously ill and\nhis mistress consults a veterinary surgeon. Does\nhe perform an operation? Does the dog recover?\nA Triumph of Surgery\n1\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n2\nI tried to sound severe: “Now I really mean this. If you don’t cut his\nfood right down and give him more exercise he is going to be really ill.\nYou must harden your heart and keep him on a very strict diet.”\nMrs Pumphrey wrung her hands. “Oh I will, Mr Herriot. I’m sure\nyou are right, but it is so difficult, so very difficult.” She set off, head\ndown, along the road, as if determined to put the new regime into\npractice immediately.\nI watched their progress with growing concern. Tricki was tottering\nalong in his little tweed coat; he had a whole wardrobe of these coats —\nfor the cold weather and a raincoat for the wet days. He struggled on,\ndrooping in his harness. I thought it wouldn’t be long before I heard\nfrom Mrs Pumphrey.\nThe expected call came within a few days. Mrs Pumphrey was\ndistraught. Tricki would eat nothing. Refused even his favourite dishes;\nand besides, he had bouts of vomiting. He spent all his time lying on a\nrug, panting. Didn’t want to go for walks, didn’t want to do anything.\nI had made my plans in advance. The only way was to get Tricki out\nof the house for a period. I suggested that he be hospitalised for about\na fortnight to be kept under observation.\nThe poor lady almost swooned. She was sure he would pine and die\nif he did not see her every day.\nBut I took a firm line. Tricki was very ill and this was the only way\nto save him; in fact, I thought it best to take him without delay and,\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Triumph of Surgery 3\nfollowed by Mrs Pumphrey’s wailings, I marched out to the car carrying\nthe little dog wrapped in a blanket.\nThe entire staff was roused and maids rushed in and out bringing\nhis day bed, his night bed, favourite cushions, toys and rubber rings,\nbreakfast bowl, lunch bowl, supper bowl. Realising that my car would\nnever hold all the stuff, I started to drive away. As I moved off, Mrs\nPumphrey, with a despairing cry, threw an armful of the little coats\nthrough the window. I looked in the mirror before I turned the corner\nof the drive; everybody was in tears.\nOut on the road, I glanced down at the pathetic little animal gasping\non the seat by my side. I patted the head and Tricki made a brave\neffort to wag his tail. “Poor old lad,” I said. “You haven’t a kick in you\nbut I think I know a cure for you.”\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• Is the narrator as rich as Tricki’s mistress?\n• How does he treat the dog?\n• Why is he tempted to keep Tricki on as a permanent guest?\n• Why does Mrs Pumphrey think the dog’s recovery is “a\ntriumph of  surgery”?\nAt the surgery, the household dogs surged round me. Tricki looked\ndown at the noisy pack with dull eyes and, when put down, lay motionless\non the carpet. The other dogs, after sniffing round him for a few seconds,\ndecided he was an uninteresting object and ignored him.\nI made up a bed for him in a warm loose box next to the one where\nthe other dogs slept. For two days I kept an eye on him, giving him no\nfood but plenty of water. At the end of the second day he started to\nshow some interest in his surroundings and on the third he began to\nwhimper when he heard the dogs in the yard.\nWhen I opened the door, Tricki trotted out and was immediately\nengulfed by Joe, the greyhound, and his friends. After rolling him over\nand thoroughly inspecting him, the dogs moved off down the garden.\nTricki followed them, rolling slightly with his surplus fat.\nLater that day, I was present at feeding time. I watched while Tristan\nslopped the food into the bowls. There was the usual headlong rush\nfollowed by the sounds of high-speed eating; every dog knew that if he\nfell behind the others he was liable to have some competition for the\nlast part of his meal.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n4\nWhen they had finished, Tricki took a walk round the shining bowls,\nlicking casually inside one or two of them. Next day, an extra bowl was\nput out for him and I was pleased to see him jostling his way towards it.\nFrom then on, his progress was rapid. He had no medicinal treatment\nof any kind but all day he ran about with the dogs, joining in their\nfriendly scrimmages. He discovered the joys of being bowled over, tramped\non and squashed every few minutes. He became an accepted member of\nthe gang, an unlikely, silky little object among the shaggy crew, fighting\nlike a tiger for his share at mealtimes and hunting rats in the old hen-\nhouse at night. He had never had such a time in his life.\nAll the while, Mrs Pumphrey hovered anxiously in the background,\nringing a dozen times a day for the latest bulletins. I dodged the\nquestions about whether his cushions were being turned regularly or\nhis correct coat worn according to the weather; but I was able to tell\nher that the little fellow was out of danger and convalescing rapidly.\nThe word ‘convalescing’ seemed to do something to Mrs Pumphrey.\nShe started to bring round fresh eggs, two dozen at a time, to build up\nTricki’s strength. For a happy period my partners and I had two eggs\neach for breakfast, but when the bottles of wine began to arrive, the\nreal possibilities of the situation began to dawn on the household.\nIt was to enrich Tricki’s blood. Lunch became a ceremonial occasion\nwith two glasses of wine before and several during the meal.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Triumph of Surgery 5\nWe could hardly believe it when the brandy came to put a final edge\non Tricki’s constitution. For a few nights the fine spirit was rolled\naround, inhaled and reverently drunk.\nThey were days of deep content, starting well with the extra egg in\nthe morning, improved and sustained by the midday wine and finishing\nluxuriously round the fire with the brandy.\nIt was a temptation to keep Tricki on as a permanent guest, but\nI knew Mrs Pumphrey was suffering and after a fortnight, felt\ncompelled to phone and tell her that the little dog had recovered\nand was awaiting collection.\nWithin minutes, about thirty feet of gleaming black metal drew up\noutside the surgery. The chauffeur opened the door and I could just\nmake out the figure of Mrs Pumphrey almost lost in the interior. Her\nhands were tightly clasped in front of her; her lips trembled. “Oh, Mr\nHerriot, do tell me the truth. Is he really better?”\n“Yes, he’s fine. There’s no need for you to get out of the car — I’ll go\nand  fetch him.”\nI walked through the house into the garden. A mass of dogs was\nhurtling round and round the lawn and in their midst, ears flapping,\ntail waving, was the little golden figure of Tricki. In two weeks he had\nbeen transformed into a lithe, hard-muscled animal; he was keeping\nup well with the pack, stretching out in great bounds, his chest almost\nbrushing the ground.\nI carried him back along the passage to the front of the house. The\nchauffeur was still holding the car door open and when Tricki saw his\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n6\nGLOSSARY\nsausage: finely minced meat stuffed into long cylindrical cases and\ndivided into small lengths by twisting or tying\nrheumy: a watery discharge from a mucous membrane especially of\nthe nose or eyes\nlistless: lacking energy and enthusiasm\nlumbago: muscular pain in the lower part of the back (lumbar region)\nregime: prescribed course of exercise and diet\ndistraught: extremely worried\nsurgery: a place where a doctor, a dentist or a veterinary surgeon treats\npatients\nscrimmage: rough or confused struggle\nconvalescing: recovering from an illness\nlithe: flexible\n1.\nWhat kind of a person do you think the narrator, a veterinary\nsurgeon, is?

She gave a startled “Ooh!” And then had to\ndefend herself as he swarmed over her, licking her face and barking.\nDuring the excitement, I helped the chauffeur to bring out the beds,\ntoys, cushions, coats and bowls, none of which had been used. As the\ncar moved away, Mrs Pumphrey leaned out of the window. Tears shone\nin her eyes. Her lips trembled.\n“Oh, Mr Herriot,” she cried, “how can I ever thank you?

And though only 15, I was an\nexperienced and fairly successful hand.\nAnil was watching a wrestling match when I approached him. He\nwas about 25 — a tall, lean fellow — and he looked easy-going, kind\nand simple enough for my purpose. I hadn’t had much luck of late and\nthought I might be able to get into the young man’s confidence.\n“You look a bit of a wrestler yourself,” I said. A little flattery helps\nin making friends.\n“So do you,” he replied, which put me off for a moment because at\nthat time I was rather thin.\n“Well,” I said modestly, “I do wrestle a bit.”\n“What’s your name?”\n“Hari Singh,” I lied. I took a new name every month. That kept me\nahead of the police and my former employers.\nAfter this introduction, Anil talked about the well-oiled wrestlers\nwho were grunting, lifting and throwing each other about. I didn’t\nhave much to say. Anil walked away. I followed casually.\n“Hello again,” he said.\nI gave him my most appealing smile. “I want to work for you,” I said.\n“But I can’t pay you.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nI thought that over for a minute.

But the meal I cooked that night must\nhave been terrible because Anil gave it to a stray dog and told me to be\noff. But I just hung around, smiling in my most appealing way, and he\ncouldn’t help laughing.\nLater, he patted me on the head and said never mind, he’d teach\nme to cook. He also taught me to write my name and said he would\nsoon teach me to write whole sentences and to add numbers. I was\ngrateful.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/2 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \n \n            ...[truncated]"

In that\nthought is drama, is there not?”\nAs he spoke, Ausable closed the door behind him. Then he switched\non the light.\nAnd as the light came on, Fowler had his first authentic thrill of\nthe day. For halfway across the room, a small automatic pistol in his\nhand, stood a man.\nAusable blinked a few times.\n“Max,” he wheezed, “you gave me quite a start. I thought you were\nin Berlin. What are you doing here in my room?”\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• How has Max got in?\n• How does Ausable say he got in?\nMax was slender, a little less than tall, with  features  that suggested\nslightly the crafty, pointed countenance of a fox. There was about him —\naside from the gun — nothing especially menacing.\n“The report,” he murmured. “The report that is being brought to\nyou tonight concerning some new missiles. I thought I would take it\nfrom you. It will be safer in my hands than in yours.”\nThe Midnight Visitor 15\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n16\nAusable moved to an armchair and sat down heavily. “I’m going to\nraise the devil with the management this time, and you can bet on it,”\nhe said grimly. “This is the second time in a month that somebody has\ngot into my room through that nuisance of a balcony!” Fowler’s eyes\nwent to the single window of the room. It was an ordinary window,\nagainst which now the night was pressing blackly.\n “Balcony?” Max said, with a rising inflection. “No, a passkey. I did\nnot know about the balcony. It might have saved me some trouble\nhad I known.”\n“It’s not my balcony,” Ausable said with extreme irritation. “It belongs\nto the next apartment.” He glanced explanatorily at Fowler. “You see,”\nhe said, “this room used to be part of a large unit, and the next room —\nthrough that door there — used to be the living room. It had the balcony,\nwhich extends under my window now. You can get onto it from the\nempty room two doors down — and somebody did, last month. The\nmanagement promised to block it off. But they haven’t.”\nMax glanced at Fowler, who was standing stiffly not far  from Ausable,\nand waved the gun with a commanding gesture. “Please sit down,” he\nsaid. “We have a wait of half an hour, I think.”\n“Thirty-one minutes,” Ausable said moodily. “The appointment was\nfor twelve-thirty. I wish I knew how you learned about the report, Max.”\nThe little spy smiled evilly. “And we wish we knew how your people\ngot the report. But no harm has been done. I will get it back tonight.\nWhat is that? Who is at the door?”\nFowler jumped at the sudden knocking at the door. Ausable just\nsmiled. “That will be the police,” he said. “I thought that such an\nimportant paper as the one we are waiting for should have a little\nextra protection. I told them to check on me to make sure everything\nwas all right.”\nMax bit his lip nervously. The knocking was repeated.\n“What will you do now, Max?” Ausable asked. “If I do not answer the\ndoor, they will enter anyway. The door is unlocked. And they will not\nhesitate to shoot.”\nMax’s face was black with anger as he backed swiftly towards the\nwindow. He swung a leg over the sill. “Send them away!” he warned. “I\nwill wait on the balcony. Send them away or I’ll shoot and take my\nchances!”\nThe knocking at the door became louder and a voice was raised.\n“Mr Ausable! Mr Ausable!”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Midnight Visitor 17\nKeeping his body twisted so that his gun still covered the fat man\nand his guest, the man at the window grasped the frame with his free\nhand to support himself. Then he swung his other leg up and over the\nwindow-sill.\nThe doorknob turned. Swiftly Max pushed with his left hand to free\nhimself from the sill and drop to the balcony. And then, as he dropped,\nhe screamed once, shrilly.\nThe door opened and a waiter stood there with a tray, a bottle and\ntwo glasses. “Here is the drink you ordered for when you returned,” he\nsaid, and set the tray on the table, deftly uncorked the bottle, and left\nthe room.\nWhite-faced, Fowler stared after him. “But...” he stammered, “the\npolice...”\n“There were no police.” Ausable sighed. “Only Henry, whom I was\nexpecting.”\n“But won’t that man out on the balcony…?” Fowler began.\n“No,” said Ausable, “he won’t return.

But it is also said that there is\nhonour among thieves. Which saying does\nthis story illustrate?\nA Question of Trust\n4\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• What does Horace Danby like to collect?\n• Why does he steal every year?\nEVERYONE thought that Horace Danby was a good, honest citizen. He was\nabout fifty years old and unmarried, and he lived with a housekeeper\nwho worried over his health. In fact, he was usually very well and happy\nexcept for attacks of hay fever in summer. He made locks and was\nsuccessful enough at his business to have two helpers. Yes, Horace\nDanby was good and respectable — but not completely honest.\nFifteen years ago, Horace had served his first and only sentence in\na prison library. He loved rare, expensive books. So he robbed a safe\nevery year. Each year he planned carefully just what he would do,\nstole enough to last for twelve months, and secretly bought the books\nhe loved through an agent.\nNow, walking in the bright July sunshine, he felt sure that this\nyear’s robbery was going to be as successful as all the others. For\ntwo weeks he had been studying the house at Shotover Grange, looking\nat its rooms, its electric wiring, its paths and its garden. This afternoon\nthe two servants, who remained in the Grange while the family was\nin London, had gone to the movies. Horace saw them go, and he felt\nhappy in spite of a little tickle of hay fever in his nose. He came out\nfrom behind the garden wall, his tools carefully packed in a bag\non his back.\nThere were about fifteen thousand pounds’ worth of jewels in the\nGrange safe. If he sold them one by one, he expected to get at least five\nReprint 2025-26\n\nthousand, enough to make him happy for another year. There were\nthree very interesting books coming up for sale in the autumn. Now he\nwould get the money he wanted to buy them.\nHe had seen the housekeeper hang the key to the kitchen door on a\nhook outside. He put on a pair of gloves, took the key, and opened the\ndoor. He was always careful not to leave any fingerprints.\nA small dog was lying in the kitchen. It stirred, made a noise, and\nmoved its tail in a friendly way.\n“All right, Sherry,” Horace said as he passed. All you had to do to\nkeep dogs quiet was to call them by their right names, and show\nthem love.\nThe safe was in the drawing room, behind a rather poor painting.\nHorace wondered for a moment whether he should collect pictures\ninstead of books. But they took up too much room. In a small house,\nbooks were better.\nThere was a great bowl of flowers on the table, and Horace felt\nhis nose tickle. He gave a little sneeze and then put down his bag.\nHe carefully arranged his tools. He had four hours before the\nservants returned.\nThe safe was not going to be hard to open. After all, he had lived\nwith locks and safes all his life. The burglar alarm was poorly built.\nHe went into the hall to cut its wire. He came back and sneezed loudly\nas the smell of the flowers came to him again.\nHow foolish people are when they own valuable things, Horace\nthought. A magazine article had described this house, giving a plan of\nall the rooms and a picture of this room. The writer had even mentioned\nthat the painting hid a safe!\nBut Horace found that the flowers were hindering him in his work.\nHe buried his face in his handkerchief.\nThen he heard a voice say from the doorway, “What is it? A cold or\nhay fever?”\nBefore he could think, Horace said, “Hay fever,” and found himself\nsneezing again.\nThe voice went on, “You can cure it with a special treatment, you\nknow, if you find out just what plant gives you the disease. I think\nyou’d better see a doctor, if you’re serious about your work. I heard you\nfrom the top of the house just now.”\nA Question of Trust 21\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n22\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• Who is speaking to Horace Danby?\n• Who is the real culprit in the story?\nIt was a quiet, kindly voice, but one with firmness in it. A woman\nwas standing in the doorway, and Sherry was rubbing against her.\nShe was young, quite pretty, and was dressed in red. She walked to\nthe fireplace and straightened the ornaments there.\n“Down, Sherry,” she said. “Anyone would think I’d been away for a\nmonth!” She smiled at Horace, and went on, “However, I came back\njust in time, though I didn’t expect to meet a burglar.”\nHorace had some hope because she seemed to be amused at meeting\nhim. He might avoid trouble if he treated her the right way. He replied,\n“I didn’t expect to meet one of the family.”\nShe nodded. “I see what an inconvenience it is for you to meet me.\nWhat are you going to do?”\nHorace said, “My first thought was to run.”\n“Of course, you could do that. But I would telephone the police and\ntell them all about you. They’d get you at once.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Question of Trust 23\nHorace said, “I would, of course, cut the telephone wires first and\nthen...,” he hesitated, a smile on his face, “I would make sure that you\ncould do nothing for some time. A few hours would be enough.”\nShe looked at him seriously. “You’d hurt me?”\nHorace paused, and then said, “I think I was trying to frighten you\nwhen I said that.”\n“You didn’t frighten me.”\nHorace suggested, “It would be nice if you would forget you ever\nsaw me. Let me go.”\nThe voice was suddenly sharp. “Why should I? You were going to\nrob me. If I let you go, you’ll only rob someone else. Society must be\nprotected from men like you.”\nHorace smiled. “I’m not a man who threatens society. I steal only\nfrom those who have a lot of money. I steal for a very good reason. And\nI hate the thought of prison.”\nShe laughed, and he begged, thinking that he had persuaded her,\n“Look, I have no right to ask you for anything, but I’m desperate. Let\nme go and I promise never to do this kind of thing again. I really\nmean it.”\nShe was silent, watching him closely. Then she said, “You are really\nafraid of going to prison, aren’t you?”\nShe came over to him shaking her head. “I have always liked the\nwrong kind of people.”\nShe picked up a silver box from the table and took a cigarette from\nit. Horace, eager to please her and seeing that she might help him,\ntook off his gloves and gave her his cigarette lighter.\n“You’ll let me go?” He held the lighter towards her.\n“Yes, but only if you’ll do something for me.”\n“Anything you say.”\n“Before we left for London, I promised my husband to take my jewels\nto our bank; but I left them here in the safe. I want to wear them to a\nparty tonight, so I came down to get them, but…”\nHorace smiled. “You’ve forgotten the numbers to open the safe,\nhaven’t you?”\n“Yes,” replied the young lady.\n“Just leave it to me and you’ll have them within an hour. But I’ll\nhave to break your safe.”\n“Don’t worry about that. My husband won’t be here for a month,\nand I’ll have the safe mended by that time.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n24\nAnd within an hour\nHorace had opened the safe,\ngiven her the jewels, and\ngone happily away.\nFor two days he kept his\npromise to the kind young\nlady. On the morning of the\nthird day, however, he\nthought of the books he\nwanted and he knew he would\nhave to look for another safe.\nBut he never got the chance\nto begin his plan. By noon a\npoliceman had arrested him\nfor the jewel robbery at\nShotover Grange.\nHis fingerprints, for he\nhad opened the safe without\ngloves, were all over the\nroom, and no one believed him when he said that the wife of the owner\nof the house had asked him to open the safe for her. The wife herself,\na gray-haired, sharp-tongued woman of sixty, said that the story\nwas nonsense.\nHorace is now the assistant librarian in the prison. He often thinks\nof the charming, clever young lady who was in the same profession as\nhe was, and who tricked him. He gets very angry when anyone talks\nabout ‘honour among thieves’.\nVICTOR CANNING\nGLOSSARY\nhay fever: a disorder affecting the nose and throat, caused by allergy\nto pollen or dust\nReprint 2025-26\n\nA Question of Trust 25\n1.\nDid you begin to suspect, before the end of the story, that the lady\nwas not the person Horace Danby took her to be?

They were damp\nfrom the rain.\nAnil’s money. In the morning he would probably have given me two or\nthree rupees to go to the cinema, but now I had it all. I couldn’t cook his\nmeals, run to the bazaar or learn to write whole sentences any more.\nI had forgotten about them in the excitement of the theft. Whole\nsentences, I knew, could one day bring me more than a few hundred\nrupees. It was a simple matter to steal — and sometimes just as simple\nto be caught. But to be a really big man, a clever and respected man,\nwas something else. I  should go back to Anil, I told myself, if only to\nlearn to read and write.\nI hurried back to the room feeling very nervous, for it is much\neasier to steal something than to return it undetected. I opened the\ndoor quietly, then stood in the doorway, in clouded moonlight. Anil\nwas still asleep. I crept to the head of the bed, and my hand came up\nwith the notes. I felt his breath on my hand. I remained still for a\nminute. Then my hand found the edge of the mattress, and slipped\nunder it with the notes.\nI awoke late next morning to find that Anil had already made the\ntea. He stretched out his hand towards me. There was a fifty-rupee\nnote between his fingers. My heart sank. I thought I had been discovered.\n“I made some money yesterday,” he explained. “Now you’ll be paid\nregularly.”\nMy spirits rose. But when I took the note, I saw it was still wet from\nthe night’s rain.\n“Today we’ll start writing sentences,” he said.\nHe knew. But neither his lips nor his eyes showed anything. I smiled\nat Anil in my most appealing way.

Following him down the musty corridor of the gloomy French\nhotel where Ausable had a room, Fowler felt let down. It was a\nsmall room, on the sixth and top floor, and scarcely a setting for a\nromantic adventure.\nAusable was, for one thing, fat. Very fat. And then there was his\naccent. Though he spoke French and German passably, he had never\naltogether lost the American accent he had brought to Paris from Boston\ntwenty years ago.\n“You are disappointed,” Ausable said wheezily over his shoulder.\n“You were told that I was a secret agent, a spy, dealing in espionage\nand danger. You wished to meet me because you are a writer, young\nand romantic. You envisioned mysterious figures in the night, the crack\nof pistols, drugs in the wine.”\n“Instead, you have spent a dull evening in a French music hall\nwith a sloppy fat man who, instead of having messages slipped into\nhis hand by dark-eyed beauties, gets only a prosaic telephone call\nmaking an appointment in his room. You have been bored!” The fat\nman chuckled to himself as he unlocked the door of his room and\nstood aside to let his frustrated guest enter.\n“You are disillusioned,” Ausable told him. “But take cheer, my young\nfriend. Presently you will see a paper, a quite important paper for\nAusable, a secret agent, is expecting to get\na very important report.

In that\nthought is drama, is there not?”\nAs he spoke, Ausable closed the door behind him. Then he switched\non the light.\nAnd as the light came on, Fowler had his first authentic thrill of\nthe day. For halfway across the room, a small automatic pistol in his\nhand, stood a man.\nAusable blinked a few times.\n“Max,” he wheezed, “you gave me quite a start. I thought you were\nin Berlin. What are you doing here in my room?”\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• How has Max got in?\n• How does Ausable say he got in?\nMax was slender, a little less than tall, with  features  that suggested\nslightly the crafty, pointed countenance of a fox. There was about him —\naside from the gun — nothing especially menacing.\n“The report,” he murmured. “The report that is being brought to\nyou tonight concerning some new missiles. I thought I would take it\nfrom you. It will be safer in my hands than in yours.”\nThe Midnight Visitor 15\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n16\nAusable moved to an armchair and sat down heavily. “I’m going to\nraise the devil with the management this time, and you can bet on it,”\nhe said grimly. “This is the second time in a month that somebody has\ngot into my room through that nuisance of a balcony!” Fowler’s eyes\nwent to the single window of the room. It was an ordinary window,\nagainst which now the night was pressing blackly.\n “Balcony?” Max said, with a rising inflection. “No, a passkey. I did\nnot know about the balcony. It might have saved me some trouble\nhad I known.”\n“It’s not my balcony,” Ausable said with extreme irritation. “It belongs\nto the next apartment.” He glanced explanatorily at Fowler. “You see,”\nhe said, “this room used to be part of a large unit, and the next room —\nthrough that door there — used to be the living room. It had the balcony,\nwhich extends under my window now. You can get onto it from the\nempty room two doors down — and somebody did, last month. The\nmanagement promised to block it off. But they haven’t.”\nMax glanced at Fowler, who was standing stiffly not far  from Ausable,\nand waved the gun with a commanding gesture. “Please sit down,” he\nsaid. “We have a wait of half an hour, I think.”\n“Thirty-one minutes,” Ausable said moodily. “The appointment was\nfor twelve-thirty. I wish I knew how you learned about the report, Max.”\nThe little spy smiled evilly. “And we wish we knew how your people\ngot the report. But no harm has been done. I will get it back tonight.\nWhat is that? Who is at the door?”\nFowler jumped at the sudden knocking at the door. Ausable just\nsmiled. “That will be the police,” he said. “I thought that such an\nimportant paper as the one we are waiting for should have a little\nextra protection. I told them to check on me to make sure everything\nwas all right.”\nMax bit his lip nervously. The knocking was repeated.\n“What will you do now, Max?” Ausable asked. “If I do not answer the\ndoor, they will enter anyway. The door is unlocked. And they will not\nhesitate to shoot.”\nMax’s face was black with anger as he backed swiftly towards the\nwindow. He swung a leg over the sill. “Send them away!” he warned. “I\nwill wait on the balcony. Send them away or I’ll shoot and take my\nchances!”\nThe knocking at the door became louder and a voice was raised.\n“Mr Ausable! Mr Ausable!”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Midnight Visitor 17\nKeeping his body twisted so that his gun still covered the fat man\nand his guest, the man at the window grasped the frame with his free\nhand to support himself. Then he swung his other leg up and over the\nwindow-sill.\nThe doorknob turned. Swiftly Max pushed with his left hand to free\nhimself from the sill and drop to the balcony. And then, as he dropped,\nhe screamed once, shrilly.\nThe door opened and a waiter stood there with a tray, a bottle and\ntwo glasses. “Here is the drink you ordered for when you returned,” he\nsaid, and set the tray on the table, deftly uncorked the bottle, and left\nthe room.\nWhite-faced, Fowler stared after him. “But...” he stammered, “the\npolice...”\n“There were no police.” Ausable sighed. “Only Henry, whom I was\nexpecting.”\n“But won’t that man out on the balcony…?” Fowler began.\n“No,” said Ausable, “he won’t return.

He was\nabout fifty years old and unmarried, and he lived with a housekeeper\nwho worried over his health. In fact, he was usually very well and happy\nexcept for attacks of hay fever in summer. He made locks and was\nsuccessful enough at his business to have two helpers. Yes, Horace\nDanby was good and respectable — but not completely honest.\nFifteen years ago, Horace had served his first and only sentence in\na prison library. He loved rare, expensive books. So he robbed a safe\nevery year. Each year he planned carefully just what he would do,\nstole enough to last for twelve months, and secretly bought the books\nhe loved through an agent.\nNow, walking in the bright July sunshine, he felt sure that this\nyear’s robbery was going to be as successful as all the others. For\ntwo weeks he had been studying the house at Shotover Grange, looking\nat its rooms, its electric wiring, its paths and its garden. This afternoon\nthe two servants, who remained in the Grange while the family was\nin London, had gone to the movies. Horace saw them go, and he felt\nhappy in spite of a little tickle of hay fever in his nose. He came out\nfrom behind the garden wall, his tools carefully packed in a bag\non his back.\nThere were about fifteen thousand pounds’ worth of jewels in the\nGrange safe. If he sold them one by one, he expected to get at least five\nReprint 2025-26\n\nthousand, enough to make him happy for another year. There were\nthree very interesting books coming up for sale in the autumn. Now he\nwould get the money he wanted to buy them.\nHe had seen the housekeeper hang the key to the kitchen door on a\nhook outside. He put on a pair of gloves, took the key, and opened the\ndoor. He was always careful not to leave any fingerprints.\nA small dog was lying in the kitchen. It stirred, made a noise, and\nmoved its tail in a friendly way.\n“All right, Sherry,” Horace said as he passed. All you had to do to\nkeep dogs quiet was to call them by their right names, and show\nthem love.\nThe safe was in the drawing room, behind a rather poor painting.\nHorace wondered for a moment whether he should collect pictures\ninstead of books. But they took up too much room. In a small house,\nbooks were better.\nThere was a great bowl of flowers on the table, and Horace felt\nhis nose tickle. He gave a little sneeze and then put down his bag.\nHe carefully arranged his tools. He had four hours before the\nservants returned.\nThe safe was not going to be hard to open. After all, he had lived\nwith locks and safes all his life. The burglar alarm was poorly built.\nHe went into the hall to cut its wire.

    "book_content": "READ AND FIND OUT\n• How did a book become a turning point in Richard\nEbright’s life?\n• How did his mother help him?\nAT the age of twenty-two, a former ‘scout of the year’ excited the scientific\nworld with a new theory on how cells work. Richard H. Ebright and his\ncollege room-mate explained the theory in an article in the Proceedings\nof the National Academy of Science.\nIt was the first time this important scientific journal had ever\npublished the work of college students. In sports, that would be like\nmaking the big leagues at the age of fifteen and hitting a home run\nyour first time at bat*. For Richard Ebright, it was the first in a long\nstring of achievements in science and other fields. And it all started\nwith butterflies.\nAn only child, Ebright grew up north of Reading, Pennsylvania.\n“There wasn’t much I could do there,” he said. “I certainly couldn’t\nplay football or baseball with a team of one. But there was one thing I\ncould do — collect things.”\nSo he did, and did he ever! Beginning in kindergarten, Ebright\ncollected butterflies with the same determination that has marked all\nhis  activities. He also collected rocks, fossils, and coins. He became\nan eager astronomer, too, sometimes star-gazing all night.\n* A home run in the game of baseball is when the batter scores a run after running safely\naround all bases and back to the home plate without stopping. A ball hit out of the playing\nfield is also called a home run. Getting a paper published at the age of fifteen in a scientific\njournal is here compared to scoring a home run while batting for the first time.\nRichard Ebright has recieved the Searle\nScholar Award and the Schering Plough\nAward for Biochemistry and Molecular\nBiology. It was his fascination for butterflies\nthat opened the world of science to him.\nThe Making of a Scientist 6\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFrom the first he had a driving curiosity along with a bright mind.\nHe also had a mother who encouraged his interest in learning. She\ntook him on trips, bought him telescopes, microscopes, cameras,\nmounting materials, and other equipment and helped him in many\nother ways.\n“I was his only companion until he started school,” his mother\nsaid. “After that I would bring home friends for him. But at night we\njust did things together. Richie was my whole life after his father died\nwhen Richie was in third grade.”\nShe and her son spent almost every evening at the dining room\ntable. “If he didn’t have things to do, I found work for him — not\nphysical work, but learning things,” his mother said. “He liked it.\nHe wanted to learn.”\nAnd learn he did. He earned top grades in school. “On everyday\nthings he was just like every other kid,” his mother said.\nBy the time he was in the second grade, Ebright had collected all twenty-\nfive species of butterflies found around his hometown. (See following box.)\nSpecies and Sub-species of Butterflies Collected in\nSix Weeks in Reading, Pennsylvania\nWood Nymphs\nand Satyrs\n• eyed brown\n• wood nymph (grayling)\nMonarchs\n• monarch or milkweed\nWhites and Sulphurs\n• olympia\n• cloudless sulphur\n• European  cabbage\nGossamer-Winged\nButterflies\n• white M hairstreak\n• acadian hairstreak\n• bronze copper\n• bog copper\n• purplish copper\n• eastern-tailed blue\n• melissa blue\n• silvery blue\nSnout Butterfly\nBrush-footed\nButterflies\n• variegated fritillary\n• Harris’s checkerspot\n• pearl crescent\n• mourning cloak\n• painted lady\n• buckeye\n• viceroy\n• white admiral\n• red-spotted purple\n• hackberry\n“That probably would have been the end of my butterfly collecting,”\nhe said. “But then my mother got me a children’s book called The\nTravels of Monarch X.” That book, which told how monarch butterflies\nmigrate to Central America, opened the world of science to the eager\nyoung collector.\nThe Making of a Scientist 33\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n34\nAt the end of the book, readers were invited to help study butterfly\nmigrations. They were asked to tag butterflies for research by Dr\nFrederick  A. Urquhart of the University of Toronto, Canada. Ebright’s\nmother wrote to Dr Urquhart, and soon Ebright was attaching light\nadhesive tags to the wings of monarchs. Anyone who found a tagged\nbutterfly was asked to send the tag to Dr Urquhart.\nThe butterfly collecting season around Reading lasts six weeks in\nlate summer. (See graph below.) If you’re going to chase them one by\none, you won’t catch very many. So the next step for Ebright was to\nraise a flock of butterflies. He would catch a female monarch, take her\neggs, and raise them in his basement through their life cycle, from egg\nto caterpillar to pupa to adult butterfly. Then he would tag the butterflies’\nwings and let them go. For several years his basement was home to\nthousands of monarchs in different stages of development.\nNumber and Kinds of Butterflies\nCollected in Six Weeks\n“Eventually I began to lose interest in tagging butterflies. It’s tedious\nand there’s not much feedback,” Ebright said. “In all the time I did it,”\nhe laughed, “only two butterflies I had tagged were recaptured — and\nthey were not more than seventy-five miles from where I lived.”\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• What lesson does Ebright learn when he does not win\nanything at a science fair?\n• What experiments and projects does he then undertake?\n• What are the qualities that go into the making of a scientist?\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nGossamer-Winged\nWood Nymphs and Satyrs\nBrush-Footed\nWhites and Sulphurs\nMonarch\nSnout\nKinds\nNumber Collected\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Making of a Scientist 35\nThen in the seventh grade he got a hint of what real science is\nwhen he entered a county science fair — and lost. “It was really a sad\nfeeling to sit there and not get anything while everybody else had won\nsomething,” Ebright said. His entry was slides of frog tissues, which\nhe showed under a microscope. He realised the winners had tried to\ndo real experiments, not simply make a neat display.\nAlready the competitive spirit that drives Richard Ebright was\nappearing. “I knew that for the next year’s fair I would have to do a real\nexperiment,” he said. “The subject I knew most about was the insect\nwork I’d been doing in the past several years.”\nSo he wrote to Dr Urquhart for ideas, and back came a stack of\nsuggestions for experiments. Those kept Ebright busy all through\nhigh school and led to prize projects in county and international\nscience fairs.\nFor his eighth grade project, Ebright tried to find the cause of a\nviral disease that kills nearly all monarch caterpillars every few years.\nEbright thought the disease might be carried by a beetle. He tried\nraising caterpillars in the presence of beetles. “I didn’t get any real\nresults,” he said. “But I went ahead and showed that I had tried the\nexperiment. This time I won.”\nThe next year his science fair project was testing the theory that\nviceroy butterflies copy monarchs. The theory was that viceroys look\nlike monarchs because monarchs don’t taste good to birds. Viceroys,\non the other hand, do taste good\nto birds. So the more they look like\nmonarchs, the less likely they are\nto become a bird’s dinner.\nEbright’s project was to see\nwhether, in fact, birds would eat\nmonarchs. He found that a\nstarling would not eat ordinary\nbird food. It would eat all the\nmonarchs it could get. (Ebright\nsaid later research by other people\nshowed that viceroys probably do\ncopy the monarch.) This project\nwas placed first in the zoology\ndivision and third overall in the\ncounty science fair.\nHow is the monarch butterfly (top)\ndifferent from the viceroy butterfly (bottom)?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n36\nIn his second year in high school, Richard Ebright began the research\nthat led to his discovery of an unknown insect hormone. lndirectly, it\nalso led to his new theory on the life of cells.\nThe question he tried to answer was simple: What is the purpose of\nthe twelve tiny gold spots on a monarch pupa?\n“Everyone assumed the spots were just ornamental,” Ebright said.\n“But Dr Urquhart didn’t believe it.”\nTo find the answer, Ebright and another excellent science student\nfirst had to build a device that showed that the spots were producing a\nhormone necessary for the butterfly’s full development.\nThis project won Ebright first place in the county fair and entry\ninto the International Science and Engineering Fair. There he won\nthird place for zoology. He also got a chance to work during the\nsummer at the entomology laboratory of the Walter Reed Army\nInstitute of Research.\nAs a high school junior, Richard Ebright continued his advanced\nexperiments on the monarch pupa. That year his project won first\nplace at the International Science Fair and gave him another chance\nto work in the army laboratory during the summer.\nIn his senior year, he went a step further. He grew cells from a\nmonarch’s wing in a culture and showed that the cells would divide\nand develop into normal butterfly wing scales only if they were fed\nthe hormone from the gold spots. That project won first place for\nzoology at the International Fair. He spent the summer after graduation\ndoing further work at the army laboratory and at the laboratory of the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThe following summer, after his freshman year at Harvard\nUniversity, Ebright went back to the laboratory of the Department of\nAgriculture and did more work on the hormone from the gold spots.\nUsing the laboratory’s sophisticated instruments, he was able to\nidentify the hormone’s chemical structure.\nA year-and-a-half later, during his junior year, Ebright got the idea\nfor his new theory about cell life. It came while he was looking at X-ray\nphotos of the chemical structure of a hormone.\nWhen he saw those photos, Ebright didn’t shout, ‘Eureka!’ or even,\n‘I’ve got it!’ But he believed that, along with his findings about insect\nhormones, the photos gave him the answer to one of biology’s puzzles:\nhow the cell can ‘read’ the blueprint of its DNA. DNA is the substance\nin the nucleus of a cell that controls heredity. It determines the form\nand function of the cell. Thus DNA is the blueprint for life.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Making of a Scientist 37\nEbright and his college room-mate, James R. Wong, worked all that\nnight drawing pictures and constructing plastic models of molecules\nto show how it could happen. Together they later wrote the paper that\nexplained the theory.\nSurprising no one who knew him, Richard Ebright graduated from\nHarvard with highest honours, second in his class of 1,510. Ebright\nwent on to become a graduate student researcher at Harvard Medical\nSchool. There he began doing experiments to test his theory.\nIf the theory proves correct, it will be a big step towards\nunderstanding the processes of life. It might also lead to new ideas for\npreventing some types of cancer and other diseases. All of this is possible\nbecause of Ebright’s scientific curiosity. His high school research into\nthe purpose of the spots on a monarch pupa eventually led him to his\ntheory about cell life.\nRichard Ebright has been interested in science since he first began\ncollecting butterflies — but not so deeply that he hasn’t time for other\ninterests. Ebright also became a champion debater and public speaker\nand a good canoeist and all-around outdoors-person. He is also an\nexpert photographer, particularly of nature and scientific exhibits.\nIn high school Richard Ebright was a straight-A student. Because\nlearning was easy, he turned a lot of his energy towards the Debating\nand Model United Nations clubs. He also found someone to admire —\nRichard A. Weiherer, his social studies teacher and adviser to both\nclubs. “Mr Weiherer was the perfect person for me then. He opened my\nmind to new ideas,” Ebright said.\n“Richard would always give that extra effort,” Mr Weiherer said.\n“What pleased me was, here was this person who put in three or four\nhours at night doing debate research besides doing all his research\nwith butterflies and his other interests.\n“Richard was competitive,” Mr Weiherer continued, “but not in a\nbad sense.” He explained, “Richard wasn’t interested in winning for\nwinning’s sake or winning to get a prize. Rather, he was winning\nbecause he wanted to do the best job he could. For the right reasons,\nhe wants to be the best.”\nAnd that is one of the ingredients in the making of a scientist.\nStart with a first-rate mind, add curiosity, and mix in the will to win\nfor the right reasons. Ebright has these qualities. From the time the\nbook, The Travels of Monarch X, opened the world of science to him,\nRichard Ebright has never lost his scientific curiosity.\nROBERT W.

Nevertheless,\nhe answered, “Very well. I will give you four hundred francs. But try to\nhave a pretty dress.”\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• What fresh problem now disturbs Mme Loisel?\n• How is the problem solved?\nThe day of the ball approached and Mme Loisel seemed sad,\ndisturbed, anxious. Nevertheless, her dress was nearly ready. Her\nhusband said to her one evening, “What is the matter with you? You\nhave acted strangely for two or three days.”\nAnd she responded, “I am vexed not to have a jewel, nothing to\nadorn myself with. I shall have such a poverty-stricken look. I would\nprefer not to go to this party.”\nHe replied, “You can wear some natural flowers. In this season\nthey look very chic.”\nShe was not convinced. “No”, she replied, “there is nothing more\nhumiliating than to have a shabby air in the midst of rich women.”\nThen her husband cried out, “How stupid we are! Go and find your\nfriend Mme Forestier and ask her to lend you her jewels.”\nShe uttered a cry of joy. “It is true!” she said. “I had not thought of that.”\nThe next day she took herself to her friend’s house and related her\nstory of distress. Mme Forestier went to her closet, took out a large\njewel-case, brought it, opened it, and said, “Choose, my dear.”\nShe saw at first some bracelets, then a collar of pearls, then a\nVenetian cross of gold and jewels of admirable workmanship. She tried\nthe jewels before the glass, hesitated, but could neither decide to take\nthem nor leave them. Then she asked, “Have you nothing more?”\n“Why, yes. Look for yourself. I do not know what will please you.”\nSuddenly she discovered, in a black satin box, a superb necklace of\ndiamonds. Her hands trembled as she took it out.  She placed it about\nher throat against her dress, and was ecstatic. Then she asked, in a\nhesitating voice, full of anxiety, “Could you lend me this? Only this?”\n“Why, yes, certainly.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n42\nShe fell upon the neck of her friend, embraced her with passion,\nthen went away with her treasure.\nThe day of the ball arrived. Mme Loisel was a great success. She\nwas the prettiest of all — elegant, gracious, smiling and full of joy. All\nthe men noticed her, asked her name, and wanted to be presented.\nShe danced with enthusiasm, intoxicated with pleasure, thinking\nof nothing but all this admiration, this victory so complete and sweet\nto her heart.\nShe went home towards four o’clock in the morning. Her husband\nhad been half asleep in one of the little salons since midnight, with\nthree other gentlemen whose wives were enjoying themselves very much.\nHe threw around her shoulders the modest wraps they had carried\nwhose poverty clashed with the elegance of the ball costume. She wished\nto hurry away in order not to be noticed by the other women who were\nwrapping themselves in rich furs.\nLoisel detained her, “Wait,” said he. “I am going to call a cab.”\nBut she would not listen and descended the steps rapidly. When\nthey were in the street, they found no carriage; and they began to seek\nfor one, hailing the coachmen whom they saw at a distance.\nThey walked along toward the river, hopeless and shivering. Finally\nthey found one of those old carriages that one sees in Paris after nightfall.\nIt took them as far as their door and they went wearily up to their\napartment. It was all over for her. And on his part, he remembered\nthat he would have to be at the office by ten o’clock.\nShe removed the wraps from her shoulders before the glass, for a\nfinal view of herself in her glory. Suddenly she uttered a cry. Her\nnecklace was not around her neck.\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• What do M. and Mme Loisel do next?\n• How do they replace the necklace?\nLoisel already half undressed, asked, “What is the matter?”\nShe turned towards him excitedly. “I have — I have — I no longer\nhave Mme Forestier’s necklace.”\nHe arose in dismay, “What! How is that? It is not possible.”\nAnd they looked in the folds of the dress, in the folds of the cloak, in\nthe pockets, everywhere. They could not find it.\nHe asked, “You are sure you still had it when we left the Minister’s house?”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Necklace 43\n“Yes, I felt it as we came out.”\n“But if you had lost it in the\nstreet, we should have heard it\nfall. It must be in the cab.”\n“Yes, it is possible. Did you\ntake the number?”\n“No. And you, did you\nnotice what it was?”\n“No.”\nThey looked at each other\nutterly cast down. Finally\nLoisel dressed himself again.\n“I am going,” he said, “over\nthe track where we went on\nfoot, to see if I can find it.”\nAnd he went. She remained\nin her evening gown, not\nhaving the force to go to bed.\nToward seven o’clock her\nhusband returned. He had  found nothing.\nHe went to the police and to the cab offices, and put an\nadvertisement in the newspapers, offering a reward.\nShe waited all day in a state of bewilderment before this frightful\ndisaster. Loisel returned in the evening, his face pale; he had\ndiscovered nothing.\nHe said, “Write to your friend that you have broken the clasp of the\nnecklace and that you will have it repaired. That will give us time.”\nShe wrote as he dictated.\nAt the end of a week, they had lost all hope. And Loisel, older by five\nyears, declared, “We must replace this jewel.”\nIn a shop of the Palais-Royal, they found a chaplet of diamonds,\nwhich seemed to them exactly like the one they had lost. It was valued\nat forty thousand francs. They could get it for thirty-six thousand.\nLoisel possessed eighteen thousand francs, which his father had left\nhim. He borrowed the rest. He made ruinous promises, took money from\nusurers and the whole race of lenders. Then he went to get the new\nnecklace, depositing on the merchant’s counter thirty-six thousand francs.\nWhen Mme Loisel took back the jewels to Mme Forestier, the latter\nsaid to her in a frigid tone, “You should have returned them to me\nsooner, for I might have needed them.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n44\nMme Forestier did not open the jewel-box as Mme Loisel feared she\nwould. What would she think if she should perceive the substitution?\nWhat should she say? Would she take her for a robber?\nMme Loisel now knew the horrible life of necessity. She did her\npart, however, completely, heroically. It was necessary to pay this\nfrightful debt. She would pay it. They sent away the maid, they changed\ntheir lodgings; they rented some rooms in an attic.\nShe learned the odious work of a kitchen. She washed the dishes.\nShe washed the soiled linen, their clothes and dishcloths, which she\nhung on the line to dry; she took down the refuse to the street each\nmorning and brought up the water, stopping at each landing to catch\nher breath. And, clothed like a woman of the people, she went to the\ngrocer’s, the butcher’s and the fruiterer’s, with her basket on her arm,\nshopping, haggling to the last sou of her miserable money.\nThe husband worked evenings, putting the books of some merchants\nin order, and nights he often did copying at five sous a page. And this\nlife lasted for ten years. At the end of ten years, they had restored all.\nMme Loisel seemed old now. She had become a strong, hard woman,\nthe crude woman of the poor household. Her hair badly dressed, her\nskirts awry, her hands red, she spoke in a loud tone, and washed the\nfloors with large pails of water. But sometimes, when her husband\nwas at the office, she would seat herself before the window and think\nof that evening party of former times, of that ball where she was so\nbeautiful and so flattered.\nHow would it have been if she had not lost the necklace? Who\nknows? How singular is life, and how full of changes! How small a\nthing will ruin or save one!\nOne Sunday as she was taking a walk in the Champs-Elysees to\nrid herself of the cares of the week, she suddenly perceived a woman\nwalking with a child. It was Mme Forestier, still young, still pretty,\nstill attractive. Mme Loisel was affected. Should she speak to her?\nYes, certainly. And now that she had paid, she would tell her all.\nWhy not?\nShe approached her. “Good morning, Jeanne.”\nHer friend did not recognise her and was astonished to be so\nfamiliarly addressed by this common personage. She stammered, “But,\nMadame — I do not know — you must be mistaken—”\n“No, I am Matilda Loisel.”\nHer friend uttered a cry of astonishment, “Oh! my poor Matilda!\nHow you have changed!”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Necklace 45\n“Yes, I have had some hard days since I saw you; and some miserable\nones — and all because of you ...”\n“Because of me? How is that?”\n“You recall the diamond necklace that you loaned me to wear to the\nMinister’s ball?”\n“Yes, very well.”\n“Well, I lost it.”\n“How is that, since you returned it to me?”\n“I returned another to you exactly like it. And it has taken us ten\nyears to pay for it. You can understand that it was not easy for us who\nhave nothing. But it is finished and I am decently content.”\nMme Forestier stopped short. She said, “You say that you bought a\ndiamond necklace to replace mine?”\n“Yes. You did not perceive it then? They were just alike.”\nAnd she smiled with proud and simple joy. Mme Forestier was\ntouched and took both her hands as she replied, “Oh! My poor Matilda!\nMine were false.

It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \nParagraph (1) \n(ii) \nWhich of the following statements best describes the comparison \nmade in the sentence ? \n1 \n \n‘‘Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices.’’  \n(A) \nGold and saffron have similar physical properties. \n(B) \nGold and saffron have equal monetary value. \n(C) \nSaffron is considered the most valuable spice, similar to how \ngold is valued among metals.  \n(D) \nGold and saffron are both rare commodities in the global \nmarket.

AND LIT.* \n# \n\n \n \n2/1/2 \nPage 2 of 19 \n# \nSECTION A \n \nReading Skills \n20 marks \n1. \nRead the following passage carefully :  \n10 \n(1) Saffron is a spice that’s long been revered across the globe, \ncaptivating hearts and palates with its deep-red hue and complex \nflavour. It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/2 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \n \n            ...[truncated]"

    "book_content": "READ AND FIND OUT\n• Why is Bholi’s father worried about her?\n• For what unusual reasons is Bholi sent to school?\nHER name was Sulekha, but since her childhood everyone had been\ncalling her Bholi, the simpleton.\nShe was the fourth daughter of Numberdar Ramlal. When she was\nten months old, she had fallen off the cot on her head and perhaps it\nhad damaged some part of her brain. That was why she remained a\nbackward child and came to be known as Bholi, the simpleton.\nAt birth, the child was very fair and pretty. But when she was two\nyears old, she had an attack of small-pox. Only the eyes were saved,\nbut the entire body was permanently disfigured by deep black pock-\nmarks. Little Sulekha could not speak till she was five, and when at\nlast she learnt to speak, she stammered. The other children often\nmade fun of her and mimicked her. As a result, she talked very little.\n Ramlal had seven children — three sons and four daughters, and\nthe youngest of them was Bholi. It was a prosperous farmer’s household\nand there was plenty to eat and drink. All the children except Bholi\nwere healthy and strong. The sons had been sent to the city to study in\nschools and later in colleges. Of the daughters, Radha, the eldest, had\nalready been married. The second daughter Mangla’s marriage had also\nbeen settled, and when that was done, Ramlal would think of the third,\nChampa. They were good-looking, healthy girls, and it was not difficult\nto find bridegrooms for them.\nBut Ramlal was worried about Bholi. She had neither good looks\nnor intelligence.\nBholi\n8\nF rom  h er v ery  childh oo d  B h oli w as\nn eglected  at h om e. W h y  d id  h er teacher\ntak e special in terest in  her? D id  B h oli\nm ea su re u p  to h er teach er’s exp ecta tion s?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n48\nBholi was seven years old when Mangla was married. The same\nyear a primary school for girls was opened in their village. The Tehsildar\nsahib came to perform its opening ceremony. He said to Ramlal, “As a\nrevenue official you are the representative of the government in the\nvillage and so you must set an example to the villagers. You must send\nyour daughters to school.”\nThat night when Ramlal consulted his wife, she cried, “Are you\ncrazy? If girls go to school, who will marry them?”\nBut Ramlal had not the courage to disobey the Tehsildar. At last his\nwife said, “I will tell you what to do. Send Bholi to school. As it is, there\nis little chance of her getting married, with her ugly face and lack of\nsense. Let the teachers at school worry about her.”\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• Does Bholi enjoy her first day at school?\n• Does she find her teacher different from the people at home?\nThe next day Ramlal caught Bholi by the hand and said, “Come\nwith me. I will take you to school.” Bholi was frightened. She did not\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBholi 49\nknow what a school was like. She remembered how a few days ago\ntheir old cow, Lakshmi, had been turned out of the house and sold.\n“N-n-n-n NO, no-no-no,” she shouted in terror and pulled her hand\naway from her father’s grip.\n“What’s the matter with you, you fool?” shouted Ramlal. “I am only\ntaking you to school.” Then he told his wife, “Let her wear some decent\nclothes today, or else what will the teachers and the other schoolgirls\nthink of us when they see her?”\nNew clothes had never been made for Bholi. The old dresses of her\nsisters were passed on to her. No one cared to mend or wash her\nclothes. But today she was lucky to receive a clean dress which had\nshrunk after many washings and no longer fitted Champa. She was\neven bathed and oil was rubbed into her dry and matted hair. Only\nthen did she begin to believe that she was being taken to a place better\nthan her home!\nWhen they reached the school, the children were already in their\nclassrooms. Ramlal handed over his daughter to the headmistress.\nLeft alone, the poor girl looked about her with fear-laden eyes. There\nwere several rooms, and in each room girls like her squatted on mats,\nreading from books or writing on slates. The headmistress asked Bholi\nto sit down in a corner in one of the classrooms.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n50\nBholi did not know what exactly a school was like and what\nhappened there, but she was glad to find so many girls almost of\nher own age present there. She hoped that one of these girls might\nbecome her friend.\nThe lady teacher who was in the class was saying something to the\ngirls but Bholi could understand nothing. She looked at the pictures\non the wall. The colours fascinated her — the horse was brown just\nlike the horse on which the Tehsildar had come to visit their village;\nthe goat was black like the goat of their neighbour; the parrot was\ngreen like the parrots she had seen in the mango orchard; and the cow\nwas just like their Lakshmi. And suddenly Bholi noticed that the teacher\nwas standing by her side, smiling at her.\n“What’s your name, little one?”\n“Bh-Bho-Bho-.” She could stammer no further than that.\nThen she began to cry and tears flowed from her eyes in a helpless\nflood. She kept her head down as she sat in her corner, not daring to\nlook up at the girls who, she knew, were still laughing at her.\nWhen the school bell rang, all the girls scurried out of the classroom,\nbut Bholi dared not leave her corner. Her head still lowered, she kept\non sobbing.\n“Bholi.”\nThe teacher’s voice was so soft and soothing! In all her life she had\nnever been called like that. It touched her heart.\n“Get up,” said the teacher. It was not a command, but just a friendly\nsuggestion. Bholi got up.\n“Now tell me your name.”\nSweat broke out over her whole body. Would her stammering tongue\nagain disgrace her? For the sake of this kind woman, however, she\ndecided to make an effort. She had such a soothing voice; she would\nnot laugh at her.\n“Bh-Bh-Bho-Bho-,” she began to stammer.\n“Well done, well done,” the teacher encouraged her. “Come on, now —\nthe full name?”\n“Bh-Bh-Bho-Bholi.” At last she was able to say it and felt relieved\nas if it was a great achievement.\n“Well done.” The teacher patted her affectionately and said,\n“Put the fear out of your heart and you will be able to speak like\neveryone else.”\nBholi looked up as if to ask, ‘Really?’\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBholi 51\n“Yes, yes, it will be very easy. You just come to school everyday.\nWill you come?”\nBholi nodded.\n“No, say it aloud.”\n“Ye-Ye-Yes.” And Bholi herself was astonished that she had been\nable to say it.\n“Didn’t I tell you? Now take this book.”\nThe book was full of nice pictures and the pictures were in colour —\ndog, cat, goat, horse, parrot, tiger and a cow just like Lakshmi. And\nwith every picture was a word in big black letters.\n“In one month you will be able to read this book. Then I will give you\na bigger book, then a still bigger one. In time you will be more learned\nthan anyone else in the village. Then no one will ever be able to laugh at\nyou. People will listen to you with respect and you will be able to speak\nwithout the slightest stammer. Understand? Now go home, and come\nback early tomorrow morning.”\nBholi felt as if suddenly all the bells in the village temple were\nringing and the trees in front of the school-house had blossomed\ninto big red flowers. Her heart was throbbing with a new hope and a\nnew life.\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• Why do Bholi’s parents accept Bishamber’s marriage  proposal?\n• Why does the marriage not take place?\nThus the years passed.\nThe village became a small town. The little primary school became\na high school. There were now a cinema under a tin shed and a cotton\nginning mill. The mail train began to stop at their railway station.\nOne night, after dinner, Ramlal said to his wife, “Then, shall I\naccept Bishamber’s proposal?”\n“Yes, certainly,” his wife said. “Bholi will be lucky to get such a\nwell-to-do bridegroom. A big shop, a house of his own and I hear\nseveral thousand in the bank. Moreover, he is not asking for any\ndowry.”\n“That’s right, but he is not so young, you know — almost the same\nage as I am — and he also limps. Moreover, the children from his first\nwife are quite grown up.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n52\n“So what does it matter?” his wife replied. “Forty-five or fifty — it is\nno great age for a man. We are lucky that he is from another village\nand does not know about her pock-marks and her lack of sense. If we\ndon’t accept this proposal, she may remain unmarried all her life.”\n“Yes, but I wonder what Bholi will say.”\n“What will that witless one say? She is like a dumb cow.”\n“May be you are right,” muttered Ramlal.\nIn the other corner of the courtyard, Bholi lay awake on her cot,\nlistening to her parents’ whispered conversation.\nBishamber Nath was a well-to-do grocer. He came with a big party\nof friends and relations with him for the wedding. A brass-band playing\na popular tune from an Indian film headed the procession, with the\nbridegroom riding a decorated horse. Ramlal was overjoyed to see such\npomp and splendour. He had never dreamt that his fourth daughter\nwould have such a grand wedding. Bholi’s elder sisters who had come\nfor the occasion were envious of her luck.\nWhen the auspicious moment came the priest said, “Bring\nthe bride.”\nBholi, clad in a red silken bridal dress, was led to the bride’s place\nnear the sacred fire.\n“Garland the bride,” one of his friends prompted Bishamber Nath.\nThe bridegroom lifted the garland of yellow marigolds. A woman\nslipped back the silken veil from the bride’s face. Bishamber took a\nquick glance. The garland remained poised in his hands. The bride\nslowly pulled down the veil over her face.\n“Have you seen her?” said Bishamber to the friend next to him.\n“She has pock-marks on her face.”\n“So what? You are not young either.”\n“Maybe. But if I am to marry her, her father must give me five\nthousand rupees.”\nRamlal went and placed his turban — his honour — at Bishamber’s\nfeet. “Do not humiliate me so. Take two thousand rupees.”\n“No. Five thousand, or we go back. Keep your daughter.”\n“Be a little considerate, please. If you go back, I can never show my\nface in the village.”\n“Then out with five thousand.”\nTears streaming down his face, Ramlal went in, opened the\nsafe and counted out the notes. He placed the bundle at the\nbridegroom’s feet.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nBholi 53\nOn Bishamber’s greedy face appeared a triumphant smile. He had\ngambled and won. “Give me the garland,” he announced.\nOnce again the veil was slipped back from the bride’s face, but this\ntime her eyes were not downcast. She was looking up, looking straight\nat her prospective husband, and in her eyes there was neither anger\nnor hate, only cold contempt.\nBishamber raised the garland to place it round the bride’s neck;\nbut before he could do so, Bholi’s hand struck out like a streak of\nlightning and the garland was flung into the fire. She got up and threw\naway the veil.\n“Pitaji!” said Bholi in a clear loud voice; and her father, mother,\nsisters, brothers, relations and neighbours were startled to hear her\nspeak without even the slightest stammer.\n“Pitaji! Take back your money. I am not going to marry this man.”\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n54\nRamlal was thunderstruck. The guests began to whisper, “So\nshameless! So ugly and so shameless!”\n“Bholi, are you crazy?” shouted Ramlal. “You want to disgrace your\nfamily? Have some regard for our izzat!”\n“For the sake of your izzat,” said Bholi, “I was willing to marry this\nlame old man. But I will not have such a mean, greedy and contemptible\ncoward as my husband. I won’t, I won’t, I won’t.”\n“What a shameless girl! We all thought she was a harmless dumb cow.”\nBholi turned violently on the old woman, “Yes, Aunty, you are\nright. You all thought I was a dumb–driven cow. That’s why you wanted\nto hand me over to this heartless creature. But now the dumb cow,\nthe stammering fool, is speaking. Do you want to hear more?”\nBishamber Nath, the grocer, started to go back with his party. The\nconfused bandsmen thought this was the end of the ceremony and\nstruck up a closing song.\nRamlal stood rooted to the ground, his head bowed low with the\nweight of grief and shame.\nThe flames of the sacred fire slowly died down. Everyone was gone.\nRamlal turned to Bholi and said, “But what about you, no one will ever\nmarry you now. What shall we do with you?”\nAnd Sulekha said in a voice that was calm and steady, “Don’t you\nworry, Pitaji! In your old age I will serve you and Mother and I will teach\nin the same school where I learnt so much. Isn’t that right, Ma’am?”\nThe teacher had all along stood in a corner, watching the drama.\n“Yes, Bholi, of course,” she replied.

Welcome to our Museum of Ancient\nHistory, and to my department — curiosities of the\ngood old, far-off twentieth century. The twentieth\ncentury was often called the Era of the Book. In those\ndays, there were books about everything, from ant\neaters to Zulus. Books taught people how to, and when\nto, and where to, and why to. They illustrated,\neducated, punctuated, and even decorated. But the\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Book That Saved the Earth 57\nstrangest thing a book ever did was to save the Earth.\nYou haven’t heard about the Martian invasion of 2040?\nTsk, tsk. What do they teach children nowadays? Well,\nyou know, the invasion never really happened, because\na single book stopped it. What was the book, you ask?\nA noble encyclopedia? A tome about rockets and\nmissiles? A secret file from outer space? No, it was\nnone of those. It was — but here, let me turn on the\nhistoriscope and show you what happened many\ncenturies ago, in 2040. (She turns on projector, and\npoints it left. Spotlight on Historian goes out, and comes\nup down left on Think-Tank, who is seated on a raised\nbox, arms folded. He has a huge, egg-shaped head, and\nhe wears a long robe decorated with stars and circles.\nApprentice Noodle stands beside him at an elaborate\nswitchboard. A sign on an easel reads:\nMARS SPACE CONTROL\nGREAT AND MIGHTY THINK-TANK, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF\n(Bow low before entering)\nNOODLE\n: (bowing) O Great and Mighty Think-Tank, most\npowerful and intelligent creature in the whole\nuniverse, what are your orders?\nTHINK-TANK\n: (peevishly) You left out part of my salutation,\nApprentice Noodle. Go over the whole thing again.\nNOODLE\n: It shall be done, sir. (in a singsong) O Great and Mighty\nThink-Tank, Ruler of Mars and her two moons, most\npowerful and intelligent creature in the whole\nuniverse — (out of breath) what-are-your-orders?\nTHINK-TANK\n: That’s better, Noodle. I wish to be placed in\ncommunication with our manned space probe to that\nridiculous little planet we are going to put under our\ngenerous rulership. What do they call it, again?\nNOODLE\n: Earth, your Intelligence.\nTHINK-TANK\n: Earth — of course. You see how insignificant the place\nis? But first, something important. My mirror. I wish\nto consult my mirror.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n58\nNOODLE\n: It shall be done, sir. (He hands Think-Tank a mirror.)\nTHINK-TANK\n: Mirror, mirror, in my hand. Who is the most\nfantastically intellectually gifted being in the land?\nOFFSTAGE VOICE\n: (after a pause) You, sir.\nTHINK-TANK\n: (smacking mirror) Quicker. Answer quicker next time.\nI hate a slow mirror. (He admires himself in the mirror.)\nAh, there I am. Are we Martians not a handsome\nrace? So much more attractive than those ugly\nEarthlings with their tiny heads. Noodle, you keep on\nexercising your mind, and someday you’ll have a\nballoon brain just like mine.\nNOODLE\n: Oh, I hope so, Mighty Think-Tank. I hope so.\nTHINK-TANK\n: Now, contact the space probe. I want to invade that\nprimitive ball of mud called Earth before lunch.\nNOODLE\n: It shall be done, sir. (He adjusts levers on switchboard.\nElectronic buzzes and beeps are heard as the curtains\nopen.)\nSCENE 2\nREAD AND FIND OUT\n• What guesses are made by Think–Tank about the books\nfound on earth?\nTIME : A few seconds later\nPLACE : Mars Space Control and the Centerville Public Library\nAT RISE : Captain Omega stands at centre, opening and closing card\ncatalogue drawers in a confused fashion. Lieutenant Iota\nis up left, counting books in a bookcase. Sergeant Oop is at\nright, opening and closing a book, turning it upside down,\nshaking it and then riffling the pages and shaking his head.\nNOODLE\n: (adjusting knobs) I have a close sighting of the space\ncrew, sir.\n(Think-Tank puts on a pair of enormous goggles and\nturns towards the stage to watch.) They seem to have\nentered some sort of Earth structure.\nTHINK-TANK\n: Excellent. Make voice contact.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Book That Saved the Earth 59\nNOODLE\n: (speaking into a microphone) Mars Space Control\ncalling the crew of Probe One.

Come in, Captain\nOmega, and give us your location.\nOMEGA\n: (speaking into a disk which is on a chain around her\nneck) Captain Omega to Mars Space  Control.\nLieutenant Iota, Sergeant Oop, and I have arrived on\nEarth without incident. We have taken shelter in this\n(indicates room) — this square place. Have you any\nidea where we are, Lieutenant Iota?\nIOTA\n: I can’t figure it out, Captain. (holding up a book) I’ve\ncounted two thousand of these peculiar items. This\nplace must be some sort of storage barn. What do you\nthink, Sergeant Oop?\nOOP\n: I haven’t a clue. I’ve been to seven galaxies, but I’ve\nnever seen anything like this. Maybe they’re hats.\n(He opens a book and puts it on his head.) Say, maybe\nthis is a haberdashery!\nOMEGA\n: (bowing low) Perhaps the Great and Mighty Think-\nTank will give us the benefit of his thought on\nthe matter.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n60\nTHINK-TANK\n: Elementary, my dear Omega. Hold one of the items\nup so that I may view it closely. (Omega holds a book\non the palm of her hand.) Yes, yes, I understand now.\nSince Earth creatures are always eating, the place\nin which you find yourselves is undoubtedly a crude\nrefreshment stand.\nOMEGA\n: (to Iota and Oop) He says we’re in a refreshment stand.\nOOP\n: Well, the Earthlings certainly have a strange diet.\nTHINK-TANK\n: That item in your hand is called a sandwich.\nOMEGA\n: (nodding) A sandwich.\nIOTA\n: (nodding) A sandwich.\nOOP\n: (taking book from his head) A sandwich?\nTHINK-TANK\n: Sandwiches are the main staple of Earth diet. Look\nat it closely.(Omega squints at book.) There are two\nslices of what is called bread, and between them is\nsome sort of filling.\nOMEGA\n: That is correct, sir.\nTHINK-TANK\n: To confirm my opinion, I order you to eat it.\nOMEGA\n: (gulping) Eat it?\nTHINK-TANK\n: Do you doubt the Mighty Think-Tank?\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Book That Saved the Earth 61\nOMEGA\n: Oh, no, no. But poor Lieutenant Iota has not had her\nbreakfast. Lieutenant Iota, I order you to eat this —\nthis sandwich.\nIOTA\n: (dubiously) Eat it? Oh, Captain! It’s a very great\nhonour to be the first Martian to eat a sandwich, I’m\nsure, but — but how can I be so impolite as to eat\nbefore my Sergeant? (handing Oop the book and saying\nbrightly) Sergeant Oop, I order you to eat the sandwich\nimmediately.\nOOP\n: (making a face) Who, Lieutenant? Me, Lieutenant?\nIOTA and OMEGA : (saluting) For the glory of Mars, Oop!\nOOP\n: Yes, of course! (unhappily) Immediately. (He opens his\nmouth wide. Omega and Iota watch him breathlessly.\nHe bites down on a corner of the book, and pantomimes\nchewing and swallowing, while making terrible faces.)\nOMEGA\n: Well, Oop?\nIOTA\n: Well, Oop? (Oop coughs. Omega and Iota pound him on\nthe back.)\nTHINK-TANK\n: Was it not delicious, Sergeant Oop?\nOOP\n: (saluting) That is correct, sir. It was not delicious. I\ndon’t know how the Earthlings can get those\nsandwiches down without water. They’re dry as\nMartian dust.\nNOODLE\n: Sir, sir. Great and Mighty Think-Tank. I beg your\npardon, but an insignificant bit of data floated into\nmy mind about those sandwiches.\nTHINK-TANK\n: It can’t be worth much, but go ahead. Give us your\ntrifling bit of data.\nNOODLE\n: Well, sir, I have seen surveyor films of those\nsandwiches. I noticed that the Earthlings did not eat\nthem. They used them as some sort of communication\ndevice.\nTHINK-TANK\n: (haughtily) Naturally. That was my next point. These\nare actually communication sandwiches. Think-Tank\nis never wrong. Who is never wrong?\nALL\n: (saluting) Great and Mighty Think-Tank is never wrong.\nTHINK-TANK\n: Therefore, I order you to listen to them.\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n62\nOMEGA\n: Listen to them?\nIOTA AND OOP\n: (to each other, puzzled) Listen to them?\nTHINK-TANK\n: Do you have marbles in your ears? I said, listen to\nthem. (Martians bow very low.)\nOMEGA\n: It shall be done, sir. (They each take two books from\nthe case, and hold them to their ears, listening intently.)\nIOTA\n: (whispering to Omega) Do you hear anything?\nOMEGA\n: (whispering back) Nothing. Do you hear anything, Oop?\nOOP\n: (loudly) Not a thing! (Omega and Iota jump in fright.)\nOMEGA AND IOTA\n: Sh-h-h! (They listen intently again.)\nTHINK-TANK\n: Well? Well? Report to me. What do you hear?\nOMEGA\n: Nothing, sir. Perhaps we are not on the correct\nfrequency.\nIOTA\n: Nothing, sir. Perhaps the Earthlings have sharper\nears than we do.\nOOP\n: I don’t hear a thing. Maybe these sandwiches don’t\nmake sounds.\nTHINK-TANK\n: What? Does somebody suggest the Mighty Think-Tank\nhas made a mistake?\nOMEGA\n: Oh, no, sir; no, sir. We’ll keep listening.\nNOODLE\n: Please excuse me, your Brilliance, but a cloudy piece\nof information is twirling around in my head.\nTHINK-TANK\n: Well, twirl it out, Noodle, and I will clarify it for you.\nNOODLE\n: I seem to recall that the Earthlings did not listen to\nthe sandwiches; they opened them and watched them.\nTHINK-TANK\n: Yes, that is quite correct, I will clarify that for you,\nCaptain Omega. Those sandwiches are not for ear\ncommunication, they are for eye communication. Now,\nCaptain Omega, take that large, colourful sandwich\nover there. It appears to be important. Tell me what\nyou observe.\n(Omega picks up a very large volume of Mother Goose,\nholding it so that the audience can see the title. Iota\nlooks over her left shoulder, and Oop peers over her\nright shoulder.)\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Book That Saved the Earth 63\nOMEGA\n: It appears to contain pictures of Earthlings.\nIOTA\n: There seems to be some sort of code.\nTHINK-TANK\n: (sharply interested) Code? I told you this was\nimportant. Describe the code.\nOOP\n: It’s little lines and squiggles and dots — thousands\nof them alongside the pictures.\nTHINK-TANK\n: Perhaps the Earthlings are not as primitive as we\nhave thought. We must break the code.\nNOODLE\n: Forgive me, your Cleverness, but did not the chemical\ndepartment give our space people vitamins to increase\ntheir intelligence?\nTHINK-TANK\n: Stop! A thought of magnificent brilliance has come to\nme. Space people, our chemical department has given\nyou vitamins to increase your intelligence. Take them\nimmediately and then watch the sandwich. The\nmeaning of the code will slowly unfold before you.\nOMEGA\n: It shall be done, sir. Remove vitamins. (Crew takes\nvitamins from boxes on their belts.) Present vitamins.\n(They hold vitamins out in front of them, stiffly.) Swallow\nReprint 2025-26\n\nFootprints without Feet\n64\nvitamins. (They pop the vitamins into their mouths and\ngulp simultaneously. They open their eyes wide, their\nheads shake, and they put their hands to their\nforeheads.)\nTHINK-TANK\n: Excellent. Now, decipher that code.\nALL\n: It shall be done, sir. (They frown over the book, turning\npages.)\nOMEGA\n: (brightly) Aha!\nIOTA\n: (brightly) Oho!\nOOP\n: (bursting into laughter) Ha, ha, ha.\nTHINK-TANK\n: What does it say? Tell me this instant. Transcribe,\nOmega.\nOMEGA\n: Yes, sir. (She reads with great seriousness.)\nMistress Mary, quite contrary,\nHow does your garden grow?\nWith cockle shells and silver bells\nAnd pretty maids all in a row.\nOOP\n: Ha, ha, ha. Imagine that. Pretty maids growing in a\ngarden.\nTHINK-TANK\n: (alarmed) Stop! This is no time for levity. Don’t you\nrealise the seriousness of this discovery? The\nEarthlings have discovered how to combine\nagriculture and mining. They can actually grow crops\nof rare metals such as silver. And cockle shells. They\ncan grow high explosives, too. Noodle, contact our\ninvasion fleet.\nNOODLE\n: They are ready to go down and take over Earth, sir.\nTHINK-TANK\n: Tell them to hold. Tell them new information has come\nto us about Earth. Iota, transcribe.\nIOTA\n: Yes, sir. (She reads very gravely.)\nHey diddle diddle! The cat and the fiddle,\nThe cow jumped over the moon,\nThe little dog laughed to see such sport,\nAnd the dish ran away with the spoon.\nOOP\n: (laughing) The dish ran away with the spoon!\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe Book That Saved the Earth 65\nTHINK-TANK\n: Cease laughter. Desist. This is more and more\nalarming. The Earthlings have reached a high level of\ncivilisation. Didn’t you hear? They have taught their\ndomesticated animals musical culture and space\ntechniques. Even their dogs have a sense of humour.\nWhy, at this very moment, they may be launching an\ninterplanetary attack of millions of cows! Notify the\ninvasion fleet. No invasion today Oop, transcribe the\nnext code.\nOOP\n: Yes, sir. (reading)\nHumpty Dumpty sat on the wall,\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall;\nAll the King’s horses and all the King’s men,\nCannot put Humpty Dumpty together again.\nOh, look, sir. Here’s a picture of Humpty Dumpty.\nWhy, sir, he looks like — he looks like — (turns large\npicture of Humpty Dumpty towards Think-Tank and\nthe audience)\nTHINK-TANK\n: (screaming and holding his head) It’s me! It’s my\nGreat and Mighty Balloon Brain. The Earthlings\nhave seen me, and they’re after me. “Had a great\nfall!” — That means they plan to capture Mars\nCentral Control and me! It’s an invasion of Mars!\nNoodle, prepare a space capsule for me. I must\nescape without delay. Space people, you must leave\nEarth at once, but be sure to remove all traces of\nyour visit. The Earthlings must not know that I\nknow. (Omega, Iota, and Oop rush about, putting\nbooks back on shelves.)\nNOODLE\n: Where shall we go, sir?\nTHINK-TANK\n: A hundred million miles away from Mars. Order the\ninvasion fleet to evacuate the entire planet of Mars.\nWe are heading for Alpha Centauri, a hundred million\nmiles away.

AND LIT.* \n# \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 2 of 19 \n# \nSECTION A \n \nReading Skills \n20 marks \n1. \nRead the following passage carefully :  \n10 \n(1) Saffron is a spice that’s long been revered across the globe, \ncaptivating hearts and palates with its deep-red hue and complex \nflavour. It is one of the most prized spices that you can find on this \nplanet. Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices. Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/1 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \nParagraph (1) \n(ii) \nWhich of the following statements best describes the comparison \nmade in the sentence ? \n1 \n \n‘‘Just like gold is among the most valuable metals in the world, \nsaffron means the same in the world of spices.’’  \n(A) \nGold and saffron have similar physical properties. \n(B) \nGold and saffron have equal monetary value. \n(C) \nSaffron is considered the most valuable spice, similar to how \ngold is valued among metals.  \n(D) \nGold and saffron are both rare commodities in the global \nmarket.

Also known as ‘kesar’ \nin Hindi, it has a rich history and is often called an ancient spice. \nSaffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the royals \nand the elite as it contains medicinal properties.  \n(2) Originating from the delicate stigma of the saffron crocus flower, it \ntransforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, infusing dishes with \na subtle, earthy sweetness that adds a special taste to the palate. \nSaffron has a strong exotic aroma and a unique flavour and is used to \ncolour and flavour many Mediterranean and Asian dishes, \nparticularly rice, fish and English, Scandinavian, and Balkan breads. \n(3) Saffron forms the backbone of several iconic dishes from around the \nworld, such as the Spanish rice, seafood dish Paella, the French stew \nBouillabaisse, Italian rice dish Risotto Milanese, the Indian ice cream \nKesar Kulfi, Pakistani rice dish Biryani, and baked Iranian rice \nTachin. Saffron’s rich red colour is attributed to crocin; its bitter \ntaste, to picrocrocin; and its distinctive aroma, to safranal.  \n(4) Saffron is cultivated chiefly in Iran but is also grown in Spain, \nFrance, Italy, and parts of India. A labour-intensive crop, the three \nstigmas are handpicked from each flower, spread on trays, and dried \nover charcoal fires for use as a food flavouring and colouring agent. \n(5) Most historians speculate it was first domesticated in Iran, but  \nsouth-western Greek islands remain strong contenders. Traders, \nconquerors, and world explorers introduced it to China, India and the \nMiddle East. From there, it travelled to Mediterranean Europe. \n\n \n \n2/1/2 \nPage 3 of 19 \n# \nP.T.O. \n(6) The high retail value of saffron is maintained in world markets \nbecause of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \n444,000 hand-picked saffron stigmas per kilogram — equivalently, \n150,000 crocus flowers per kilogram. Forty hours of labour are needed \nto pick 150,000 flowers. Almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain \nin the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of \nglobal production. Afghanistan comes second, and Spain is the third \nlargest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian \nsubcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers. \n(7) Given its high price, adulteration is quite common, unfortunately. \nAdulterants like beetroot or pomegranate are used to enhance red \ncolour; silk fibres, oil, or wax are used to add bulk, and powdered \nsaffron can be adulterated with turmeric and paprika.  \nAnswer the following questions, based on the above passage : \n(i) \nWhat is the tone of the writer in the given lines ? \n1 \n \nRationalise your response in about 40 words.   \n‘‘Saffron is being used since ages in various foods made for the \nroyals and the elite as it contains medicinal properties.’’  \n \n            ...[truncated]"
